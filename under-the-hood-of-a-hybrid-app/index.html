<p>It has been about a year since we had <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/under-the-hood-of-teamwork-chat/" rel="noopener">A peek under the hood of Teamwork Chat</a>. Since then, we’ve added a few nice features, fixed some bugs, and introduced a couple. You know how it goes. More and more companies are using our app, including some really famous ones. At the time of writing this, over 12 million messages have been sent. Teamwork has grown three times in size, and the Teamwork Chat team with it, thanks to some great hires.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of my predictions from last year’s post;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As NW.js (0.12.0) is basically Chrome (41), we can just put our desktop app on the Web and it will basically just work. That’s a simplification but you get the picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with our Windows and Mac OS X desktop apps, <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">Teamwork Chat</a> is now available in your favourite Web browser. This was almost as easy as we expected. See <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/author/donal/" rel="noopener">Donal’s</a> recent <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/how-we-sped-up-serving-static-files-in-teamwork-chat/" rel="noopener">Deploying the Teamwork Chat Web app</a> post for more.</p>
<p>Sure, Teamwork Chat is a mobile-first responsive app, so yes, users could access Teamwork Chat on their phones. This was welcomed with open arms, but did I make any mobile <em>app</em> predictions?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even further, we should be able to create Android and iOS apps by sticking our app in a WebView. We’re attempting to build a consistent experience across all platforms from the one codebase. It’s not as easy as I make out though; expect more posts to follow up on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, and that’s what we’ve done. In this post, I’m going to describe how our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamwork.chat&hl=en" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teamwork-chat/id978062035?mt=8" rel="noopener">iOS</a> apps came to be, lessons we’ve learned along the way, and where we’re headed. Not only in respect to mobile apps, but Teamwork Chat as a whole.</p>

<p>We released our first internal prototype about a year ago; a mash of Appcelerator and some Web code. It wasn’t as nice as we thought it would be. We would’ve needed to put in a lot more work to make it really usable. We had bigger fish to fry though. After a painful period of trying to maintain it while delivering key features, it was put to one side. We eventually got back to it, starting again from scratch.</p>
<p>Of course, we wanted Android and iOS apps which allowed you to do everything you could already do in Teamwork Chat. Push notifications and being able to share a file to the app were minimum requirements as well. Unlike other apps where you could get away without those, they’re critical for any chat app. We imagined that the least the Teamwork Chat mobile apps could do is allow you to contact someone while on the go and stay in the loop, as well as quickly share a photo you’ve just taken, for example.</p>
<p>Our intention, as much now as it was then, is to have a consistent and familiar experience across all of our apps. Someone should be easily able to start a conversation on one device and carry it on elsewhere.</p>

<p>By this stage, users were crying out for mobile apps. Our plan was to get mobile apps out there and improve on them. We planned to reuse our Web app and see how far we could get. We took ownership of (most of) the app as apposed to our mobile team here at Teamwork. We got a lot of the way for free as we had already fought to maintain (mobile-first) reponsiveness and touch-friendliness throughout. We got an iPad app for free due to the fact our app is responsive. Note: we’ve never used device-orientated breakpoints in our designs.</p>
<p>Now, mobile apps are also considered in every feature from the beginning. Reusing code between our Web, desktop, and mobile apps enables us to fix a bug once and it’s fixed everywhere. As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac & Windows desktop apps, our Android & iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.</p>
<p>It was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t <em>responsible</em>. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.</p>

        </figure><p>We forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.</p>

<p>Enough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.</p>
<p>The native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.</p>
<p>Notifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.</p>
<p>You can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.</p>

<p>OK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.</p>
<p>A lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.</p>
<p>We put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.</p>

          <figcaption><p>The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.</p>
</figcaption>
        </figure><p>Android and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.</p>
<p>Once the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.</p>
<p>These days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.</p>

<p>This is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.</p>
<p>This certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.</p>
<p>Yes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.</p>
<p>In order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.</p>
<p>This comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.</p>
<p>I wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.</p>
<p>To make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?</p>

<p>Working on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.</p>
<p>Even though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.</p>
<p>By changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.</p>
<p>This is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> to <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a> would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.</p>

<p>We’ve been talking about using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">proper feature flags</a> for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.</p>
<p>Teamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Expecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first. The terrible piece of software that is iTunes Connect gives you the option to release the app immediately once it has been validated, on or past a certain date, as well as a manual release. We opted for a manual release. The plan was that was once we were alerted that the app was ready, we’d submit the Android app, and once that was out, we’d hit the publish button. Note: the Google Play Developer Console (which is awful too) has added a manual release option since then.</p>
<p>Our iOS app was rejected. Argh! We had marketing campaigns ongoing teasing something big, we had to quickly come up with a plan B. We didn’t want to be empty handed when the end of the month came by. Why did it fail? Basically, there was a misunderstanding in what our app was, and who it was targeted at. We promptly submitted an appeal, and even though we knew we were right, we were amazed to see the decision overturned a couple of days later. The Android release took a couple of hours, and that was it, the Teamwork Chat mobile apps were out there. We were ecstatic.</p>

<p>There is definitely room for improvement, I’ll be the first to say it. They could be faster, start up quicker, be less janky, and so on. We’re going to work hard on this. The great thing is that this these efforts will translate into improvements in the Web and desktop apps as well.</p>
<p>We will be making native mobile apps. We have planned to for awhile now. We have some mobile developers in-house dying for a crack at it. Expect a couple of great apps that really feel at home in your OS. One upside to going down the native route is that users can see you care as you’ve tailored an app to their OS. Sure they’ll be distinct, the Android one will have a strong material design feel, but we’ll strive to keep in sync with each other and Teamwork Chat in general when it comes to features as well as the overall experience.</p>
<p>Sure, this means we’ll have fewer eyes on our Web app on a mobile Web browser or narrow screen, but it’s worth it.</p>

<p>Right now, our desktop apps need to built on Windows for Windows and on Mac for Mac. This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.</p>
<p>While we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly <a href="http://dploy.io" rel="noopener">dploy.io</a>) to <a href="https://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a> for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.</p>
<p>All of our services are now deployed once we push to <code>master</code>. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.</p>
<p>There are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain <code>[skip-resp-tests]</code> exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.</p>

<p>We haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a>. Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html" rel="noopener"><strong>cluster</strong></a> module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.</p>
<p>As I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via <code>cluster</code> or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.</p>
<p>How our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general. We’re going to switch over to RabbitMQ from Redis, re-do a lot of the messaging, and try to remove the dependency on a shared database at the same time.</p>

Since then, we’ve added a few nice features, fixed some bugs, and introduced a couple. You know how it goes. More and more companies are using our app, including some really famous ones. At the time of writing this, over 12 million messages have been sent. Teamwork has grown three times in size, and the Teamwork Chat team with it, thanks to some great hires.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of my predictions from last year’s post;\n\n> As NW.js (0.12.0) is basically Chrome (41), we can just put our desktop app on the Web and it will basically just work. That’s a simplification but you get the picture.\n\nAlong with our Windows and Mac OS X desktop apps, [Teamwork Chat](https://www.teamwork.com/chat) is now available in your favourite Web browser. This was almost as easy as we expected. See [Donal’s](http://engineroom.teamwork.com/author/donal/) recent [Deploying the Teamwork Chat Web app](http://engineroom.teamwork.com/how-we-sped-up-serving-static-files-in-teamwork-chat/) post for more.\n\nSure, Teamwork Chat is a mobile-first responsive app, so yes, users could access Teamwork Chat on their phones. This was welcomed with open arms, but did I make any mobile *app* predictions?\n\n> Even further, we should be able to create Android and iOS apps by sticking our app in a WebView. We’re attempting to build a consistent experience across all platforms from the one codebase. It’s not as easy as I make out though; expect more posts to follow up on this.\n\nYep, and that’s what we’ve done. In this post, I’m going to describe how our [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamwork.chat&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teamwork-chat/id978062035?mt=8) apps came to be, lessons we’ve learned along the way, and where we’re headed. Not only in respect to mobile apps, but Teamwork Chat as a whole.\n\n### Mobile apps, finally\n\nWe released our first internal prototype about a year ago; a mash of Appcelerator and some Web code. It wasn’t as nice as we thought it would be. We would’ve needed to put in a lot more work to make it really usable. We had bigger fish to fry though. After a painful period of trying to maintain it while delivering key features, it was put to one side. We eventually got back to it, starting again from scratch.\n\nOf course, we wanted Android and iOS apps which allowed you to do everything you could already do in Teamwork Chat. Push notifications and being able to share a file to the app were minimum requirements as well. Unlike other apps where you could get away without those, they’re critical for any chat app. We imagined that the least the Teamwork Chat mobile apps could do is allow you to contact someone while on the go and stay in the loop, as well as quickly share a photo you’ve just taken, for example.\n\nOur intention, as much now as it was then, is to have a consistent and familiar experience across all of our apps. Someone should be easily able to start a conversation on one device and carry it on elsewhere.\n\n### Reusing our Web app\n\nBy this stage, users were crying out for mobile apps. Our plan was to get mobile apps out there and improve on them. We planned to reuse our Web app and see how far we could get. We took ownership of (most of) the app as apposed to our mobile team here at Teamwork. We got a lot of the way for free as we had already fought to maintain (mobile-first) reponsiveness and touch-friendliness throughout. We got an iPad app for free due to the fact our app is responsive. Note: we’ve never used device-orientated breakpoints in our designs.\n\nNow, mobile apps are also considered in every feature from the beginning. Reusing code between our Web, desktop, and mobile apps enables us to fix a bug once and it’s fixed everywhere. As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac & Windows desktop apps, our Android & iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.\n\nIt was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t *responsible*. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.\n\n:::figure under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png A navigation menu we tweaked.\n:::\n\nWe forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.\n\n### Native wrappers\n\nEnough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.\n\nThe native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.\n\nNotifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.\n\nYou can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.\n\n### But what about *real* mobile apps?\n\nOK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.\n\nA lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.\n\nWe put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.\n\n### Sharing\n\n:::figure under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.\n:::\n\nAndroid and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.\n\nOnce the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.\n\nThese days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.\n\n### Feature parity\n\nThis is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.\n\nThis certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.\n\nYes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.\n\nIn order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.\n\nThis comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.\n\nI wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.\n\nTo make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?\n\n### Living with a mobile app\n\nWorking on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.\n\nEven though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.\n\nBy changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.\n\nThis is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) to [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.\n\n### Feature flags\n\nWe’ve been talking about using [proper feature flags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY) for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.\n\nTeamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.\n\n### The release\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExpecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first. The terrible piece of software that is iTunes Connect gives you the option to release the app immediately once it has been validated, on or past a certain date, as well as a manual release. We opted for a manual release. The plan was that was once we were alerted that the app was ready, we’d submit the Android app, and once that was out, we’d hit the publish button. Note: the Google Play Developer Console (which is awful too) has added a manual release option since then.\n\nOur iOS app was rejected. Argh! We had marketing campaigns ongoing teasing something big, we had to quickly come up with a plan B. We didn’t want to be empty handed when the end of the month came by. Why did it fail? Basically, there was a misunderstanding in what our app was, and who it was targeted at. We promptly submitted an appeal, and even though we knew we were right, we were amazed to see the decision overturned a couple of days later. The Android release took a couple of hours, and that was it, the Teamwork Chat mobile apps were out there. We were ecstatic.\n\n### The future\n\nThere is definitely room for improvement, I’ll be the first to say it. They could be faster, start up quicker, be less janky, and so on. We’re going to work hard on this. The great thing is that this these efforts will translate into improvements in the Web and desktop apps as well.\n\nWe will be making native mobile apps. We have planned to for awhile now. We have some mobile developers in-house dying for a crack at it. Expect a couple of great apps that really feel at home in your OS. One upside to going down the native route is that users can see you care as you’ve tailored an app to their OS. Sure they’ll be distinct, the Android one will have a strong material design feel, but we’ll strive to keep in sync with each other and Teamwork Chat in general when it comes to features as well as the overall experience.\n\nSure, this means we’ll have fewer eyes on our Web app on a mobile Web browser or narrow screen, but it’s worth it.\n\n### Automation and deployment\n\nRight now, our desktop apps need to built on Windows for Windows and on Mac for Mac. This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly dploy.io) to [CodeShip](https://codeship.com/) for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.\n\nAll of our services are now deployed once we push to `master`. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.\n\nThere are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain `[skip-resp-tests]` exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.\n\n### Lessons learned\n\nWe haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off [Teamwork Projects](https://teamwork.com/projects). Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ [**cluster**](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.\n\nAs I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via `cluster` or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.\n\nHow our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general. We’re going to switch over to RabbitMQ from Redis, re-do a lot of the messaging, and try to remove the dependency on a shared database at the same time.\n\n### Fire in the hole\n\nAs well as improving areas we’ve neglected, these are some of the bigger higher level features we have coming down the line:\n\n-  API\n-  Bots (prepared third-party bots and a bot API/platform)\n-  Conversation switcher\n-  Deeper integrations with [Teamwork Desk](https://teamwork.com/desk) and [Teamwork Projects](https://teamwork.com/projects)\n-  Email improvements\n-  Independent signup\n-  Linux desktop app\n-  More third-party integrations (including cards, bots, etc.)\n-  Native (Android & iOS) mobile apps\n-  Noise reduction (do not disturb, muting, notification settings, etc.)\n-  Opening Teamwork Chat to users outside the owner company\n-  Search\n\nThat’s all folks! We’ll catch up again next year. Feel free to reach out to us at [chat@teamwork.com](mailto:chat@teamwork.com) with any API or bot-related ideas or features requests. We’d love to know what you’d expect to see in our API.

As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac &amp; Windows desktop apps, our Android &amp; iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.</p>\n<p>It was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t <em>responsible</em>. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A navigation menu we tweaked.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>We forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.</p>\n<h3><a id="native-wrappers" class="post-header-anchor" href="#native-wrappers" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Native wrappers</h3>\n<p>Enough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.</p>\n<p>The native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.</p>\n<p>Notifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.</p>\n<p>You can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.</p>\n<h3><a id="but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" class="post-header-anchor" href="#but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>But what about <em>real</em> mobile apps?</h3>\n<p>OK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.</p>\n<p>A lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.</p>\n<p>We put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.</p>\n<h3><a id="sharing" class="post-header-anchor" href="#sharing" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Sharing</h3>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Android and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.</p>\n<p>Once the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.</p>\n<p>These days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-parity" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-parity" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature parity</h3>\n<p>This is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.</p>\n<p>This certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.</p>\n<p>Yes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.</p>\n<p>In order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.</p>\n<p>This comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.</p>\n<p>I wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.</p>\n<p>To make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?</p>\n<h3><a id="living-with-a-mobile-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#living-with-a-mobile-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Living with a mobile app</h3>\n<p>Working on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.</p>\n<p>Even though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.</p>\n<p>By changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.</p>\n<p>This is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> to <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a> would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-flags" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-flags" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature flags</h3>\n<p>We’ve been talking about using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">proper feature flags</a> for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.</p>\n<p>Teamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-release" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-release" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The release</h3>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Expecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first. The terrible piece of software that is iTunes Connect gives you the option to release the app immediately once it has been validated, on or past a certain date, as well as a manual release. We opted for a manual release. The plan was that was once we were alerted that the app was ready, we’d submit the Android app, and once that was out, we’d hit the publish button. Note: the Google Play Developer Console (which is awful too) has added a manual release option since then.</p>\n<p>Our iOS app was rejected. Argh! We had marketing campaigns ongoing teasing something big, we had to quickly come up with a plan B. We didn’t want to be empty handed when the end of the month came by. Why did it fail? Basically, there was a misunderstanding in what our app was, and who it was targeted at. We promptly submitted an appeal, and even though we knew we were right, we were amazed to see the decision overturned a couple of days later. The Android release took a couple of hours, and that was it, the Teamwork Chat mobile apps were out there. We were ecstatic.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-future" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-future" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The future</h3>\n<p>There is definitely room for improvement, I’ll be the first to say it. They could be faster, start up quicker, be less janky, and so on. We’re going to work hard on this. The great thing is that this these efforts will translate into improvements in the Web and desktop apps as well.</p>\n<p>We will be making native mobile apps. We have planned to for awhile now. We have some mobile developers in-house dying for a crack at it. Expect a couple of great apps that really feel at home in your OS. One upside to going down the native route is that users can see you care as you’ve tailored an app to their OS. Sure they’ll be distinct, the Android one will have a strong material design feel, but we’ll strive to keep in sync with each other and Teamwork Chat in general when it comes to features as well as the overall experience.</p>\n<p>Sure, this means we’ll have fewer eyes on our Web app on a mobile Web browser or narrow screen, but it’s worth it.</p>\n<h3><a id="automation-and-deployment" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automation-and-deployment" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automation and deployment</h3>\n<p>Right now, our desktop apps need to built on Windows for Windows and on Mac for Mac. This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly <a href="http://dploy.io" rel="noopener">dploy.io</a>) to <a href="https://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a> for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.</p>\n<p>All of our services are now deployed once we push to <code>master</code>. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.</p>\n<p>There are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain <code>[skip-resp-tests]</code> exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.</p>\n<h3><a id="lessons-learned" class="post-header-anchor" href="#lessons-learned" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Lessons learned</h3>\n<p>We haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a>. Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html" rel="noopener"><strong>cluster</strong></a> module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.</p>\n<p>As I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via <code>cluster</code> or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.</p>\n<p>How our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general. We’re going to switch over to RabbitMQ from Redis, re-do a lot of the messaging, and try to remove the dependency on a shared database at the same time.</p>\n<h3><a id="fire-in-the-hole" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fire-in-the-hole" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fire in the hole</h3>\n<p>As well as improving areas we’ve neglected, these are some of the bigger higher level features we have coming down the line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API</li>\n<li>Bots (prepared third-party bots and a bot API/platform)</li>\n<li>Conversation switcher</li>\n<li>Deeper integrations with <a href="https://teamwork.com/desk" rel="noopener">Teamwork Desk</a> and <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a></li>\n<li>Email improvements</li>\n<li>Independent signup</li>\n<li>Linux desktop app</li>\n<li>More third-party integrations (including cards, bots, etc.)</li>\n<li>Native (Android &amp; iOS) mobile apps</li>\n<li>Noise reduction (do not disturb, muting, notification settings, etc.)</li>\n<li>Opening Teamwork Chat to users outside the owner company</li>\n<li>Search</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all folks!

Since then, we’ve added a few nice features, fixed some bugs, and introduced a couple. You know how it goes. More and more companies are using our app, including some really famous ones. At the time of writing this, over 12 million messages have been sent. Teamwork has grown three times in size, and the Teamwork Chat team with it, thanks to some great hires.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of my predictions from last year’s post;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As NW.js (0.12.0) is basically Chrome (41), we can just put our desktop app on the Web and it will basically just work. That’s a simplification but you get the picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with our Windows and Mac OS X desktop apps, <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">Teamwork Chat</a> is now available in your favourite Web browser. This was almost as easy as we expected.

This was welcomed with open arms, but did I make any mobile <em>app</em> predictions?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even further, we should be able to create Android and iOS apps by sticking our app in a WebView. We’re attempting to build a consistent experience across all platforms from the one codebase. It’s not as easy as I make out though; expect more posts to follow up on this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, and that’s what we’ve done. In this post, I’m going to describe how our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamwork.chat&amp;hl=en" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teamwork-chat/id978062035?mt=8" rel="noopener">iOS</a> apps came to be, lessons we’ve learned along the way, and where we’re headed.

It wasn’t as nice as we thought it would be. We would’ve needed to put in a lot more work to make it really usable. We had bigger fish to fry though. After a painful period of trying to maintain it while delivering key features, it was put to one side. We eventually got back to it, starting again from scratch.</p>\n<p>Of course, we wanted Android and iOS apps which allowed you to do everything you could already do in Teamwork Chat. Push notifications and being able to share a file to the app were minimum requirements as well. Unlike other apps where you could get away without those, they’re critical for any chat app. We imagined that the least the Teamwork Chat mobile apps could do is allow you to contact someone while on the go and stay in the loop, as well as quickly share a photo you’ve just taken, for example.</p>\n<p>Our intention, as much now as it was then, is to have a consistent and familiar experience across all of our apps. Someone should be easily able to start a conversation on one device and carry it on elsewhere.</p>\n<h3><a id="reusing-our-web-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#reusing-our-web-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Reusing our Web app</h3>\n<p>By this stage, users were crying out for mobile apps. Our plan was to get mobile apps out there and improve on them. We planned to reuse our Web app and see how far we could get. We took ownership of (most of) the app as apposed to our mobile team here at Teamwork. We got a lot of the way for free as we had already fought to maintain (mobile-first) reponsiveness and touch-friendliness throughout. We got an iPad app for free due to the fact our app is responsive. Note: we’ve never used device-orientated breakpoints in our designs.</p>\n<p>Now, mobile apps are also considered in every feature from the beginning. Reusing code between our Web, desktop, and mobile apps enables us to fix a bug once and it’s fixed everywhere. As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac &amp; Windows desktop apps, our Android &amp; iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.</p>\n<p>It was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t <em>responsible</em>. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A navigation menu we tweaked.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>We forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.</p>\n<h3><a id="native-wrappers" class="post-header-anchor" href="#native-wrappers" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Native wrappers</h3>\n<p>Enough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.</p>\n<p>The native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.</p>\n<p>Notifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.</p>\n<p>You can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.</p>\n<h3><a id="but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" class="post-header-anchor" href="#but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>But what about <em>real</em> mobile apps?</h3>\n<p>OK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.</p>\n<p>A lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.</p>\n<p>We put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.</p>\n<h3><a id="sharing" class="post-header-anchor" href="#sharing" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Sharing</h3>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Android and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.</p>\n<p>Once the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.</p>\n<p>These days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-parity" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-parity" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature parity</h3>\n<p>This is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.</p>\n<p>This certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.</p>\n<p>Yes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.</p>\n<p>In order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.</p>\n<p>This comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.</p>\n<p>I wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.</p>\n<p>To make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?</p>\n<h3><a id="living-with-a-mobile-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#living-with-a-mobile-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Living with a mobile app</h3>\n<p>Working on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.</p>\n<p>Even though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.</p>\n<p>By changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.</p>\n<p>This is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> to <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a> would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-flags" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-flags" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature flags</h3>\n<p>We’ve been talking about using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">proper feature flags</a> for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.</p>\n<p>Teamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-release" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-release" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The release</h3>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Expecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first.

This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly <a href="http://dploy.io" rel="noopener">dploy.io</a>) to <a href="https://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a> for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.</p>\n<p>All of our services are now deployed once we push to <code>master</code>. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.</p>\n<p>There are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain <code>[skip-resp-tests]</code> exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.</p>\n<h3><a id="lessons-learned" class="post-header-anchor" href="#lessons-learned" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Lessons learned</h3>\n<p>We haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a>. Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html" rel="noopener"><strong>cluster</strong></a> module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.</p>\n<p>As I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via <code>cluster</code> or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.</p>\n<p>How our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general. We’re going to switch over to RabbitMQ from Redis, re-do a lot of the messaging, and try to remove the dependency on a shared database at the same time.</p>\n<h3><a id="fire-in-the-hole" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fire-in-the-hole" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fire in the hole</h3>\n<p>As well as improving areas we’ve neglected, these are some of the bigger higher level features we have coming down the line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API</li>\n<li>Bots (prepared third-party bots and a bot API/platform)</li>\n<li>Conversation switcher</li>\n<li>Deeper integrations with <a href="https://teamwork.com/desk" rel="noopener">Teamwork Desk</a> and <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a></li>\n<li>Email improvements</li>\n<li>Independent signup</li>\n<li>Linux desktop app</li>\n<li>More third-party integrations (including cards, bots, etc.)</li>\n<li>Native (Android &amp; iOS) mobile apps</li>\n<li>Noise reduction (do not disturb, muting, notification settings, etc.)</li>\n<li>Opening Teamwork Chat to users outside the owner company</li>\n<li>Search</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all folks!

First shipped with Windows 97, Clippy was a “smart” assistant for Microsoft Office. A selfless shape-shifting paperclip who would appear out of nowhere to help you in any way it could. And how did you treat Clippy? Yeah, you should be ashamed of yourself. You either loved or hated Clippy. **Spoiler**: after a lot of backlash, Microsoft secretly ran a smear campaign against its own little paperclip, including an anti-Clippy Website, a “Kill Clippy” game, and more. _“I see you’re trying to destroy me, would you like help with that?”_ Clippy said. Eventually retiring Clippy to fanfare, Microsoft masterfully spun your anger into positive press. Shame on all of you.\n\nI’m sure you’ve only recently stopped having guilt-ridden nightmares of a dancing paperclip, but I’ve good news. I’ve made a desktop application which not only brings Clippy back to Windows, but introduces Mac and Linux users to 90’s Siri too! Clippy.desktop is available for download at [teamwork.github.io/clippy.desktop](https://teamwork.github.io/clippy.desktop).\n\nWhy? Because I can. There’s just something satisfying about seeing Clippy on Windows 10 or El Capitan. It wasn’t even hard; I feel like an imposter for simply throwing together a few open-source things, so I’m going to use this an opportunity to share how easy it is to make a desktop app with NW.js (and a few pitfalls). For extra measure, here’s an embarrassing photo of me as a child:\n\n:::figure resurrecting-clippy/embarrassing.jpg Look at those curls.\n:::\n\n### Desktop (Web) apps\n\nQuickly moving on, [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) was an obvious choice to make the app as we built the [Teamwork Chat](https://teamwork.com/chat) desktop apps with it. NW.js, along with the trendier [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), combines Chromium and Node.js to allow you to create a desktop application from a Web application. So the resultant executable is a standalone appplication just like Chrome which has access to all of the Node.js API as well. It’s great.\n\nIt doesn’t take long to get up and running either. You technically don’t need Node.js to develop an NW.js app, but I’ll assume you have it. First, grab the offical npm package; run `npm install -g nw` to make it available from anywhere on your machine. In a new directory named `clippy-desktop`, create a HTML file with whatever content you\'d like. All we need now is an "app manifest"; run `npm init` and follow the steps the generate one. Enter the name of your HTML file when asked for the `main` file. Why `npm init`? The app manifest is basically the same as any npm module\'s `package.json` (where its dependencies are listed, and so on.). So, now you have a basic manifest looks something like this:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  "name": "clippy-desktop",\n  "version": "0.0.1",\n  "main": "index.html",\n  "dependencies": {}\n}\n```\n\nNow, run `nw clippy-desktop`.\n\n:::figure resurrecting-clippy/running.png\n:::\n\nTa-da! Your app is running. If you don’t believe me, click the hamburger icon in the top right to access the DevTools and inspect the HTML.\n\n### Hello, Clippy!\n\nOk, ok, I’ll get to Clippy already. All credit to [Smore](https://www.smore.com) for creating a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of clippy **in a weekend**; [ClippyJS](https://www.smore.com/clippy-js) is impressive! Let’s use it in our app.\n\nSmore recommend downloading the CSS and JavaScript files from the ClippyJS GitHub repository, but let’s use this as an oppurtunity to learn how using dependencies from npm works. npm is Node.js’ package manager we used earlier to install `nw`. ClippyJS isn\'t on npm (yet) but it is on GitHub and npm allows us to install it straight from GitHub by running `npm install --save smore-inc/clippy.js`. That would work but if the ClippyJS repository wasn\'t missing the manifest every Node.js module needs. So I\'ve forked the ClippyJS repository and added the `package.json` (note that I\'ve added jQuery under `dependencies`). Now, running `npm install --save adam-lynch/clippy.js#pkg` will install ClippyJS into `clippy-desktop/node_modules`. To include ClippyJS we have to reference the CSS and JavaScript files just like we would in any Web app, adding `<link href="node_modules/clippy.js/build/clippy.css" rel="stylesheet"/>` and `<script src="node_modules/clippy.js/build/clippy.min.js"><\/script>` to the correct files.\n\nNote: Just in case you’ve noticed that Clippy.desktop’s `index.html` doesn\'t reference each file like I\'ve just said; I\'ve combined the dependencies into `third-party.js` just to make it cleaner, similarly to what\'s described in [Hassle-free third-party dependencies](https://adamlynch.com/hassle-free-third-party-dependencies/).\n\nThe ClippyJS site says we’ll need to programatically show Clippy ourselves, so let’s create a `script.js` with the following contents:\n\n```javascript\nclippy.load(\'Clippy\', function(agent) {\n    agent.show();\n});\n```\n\nTo resurrect Clippy:\n\n- Make sure you’ve added a `<script>` linking to your `script.js`.\n- Kill the running app.\n- Run `nw clippy-desktop` again.\n\n### What now?!\n\nHuh. It’s not working. Open the DevTools and check for any errors. Hmm…\n\n```javascript\nFailed to load resource: net::ERR\\_FILE\\_NOT\\_FOUND\n```\n\nAh, the problem is [this line](https://github.com/smore-inc/clippy.js/blob/master/src/load.js#L1) in the ClippyJS source:\n\n```javascript\nclippy.BASE_PATH = \'//s3.amazonaws.com/clippy.js/Agents/\';\n```\n\nThe main ClippyJS file seems to be requesting more scripts from Amazon S3\\. See that the URL begins with `//` That\'s a [protocol-relative URL](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/), i.e. if the current site was accessed over HTTPS, HTTPS will be used as the protocol when requesting this URL, or HTTP if the site was accessed over HTTP. But the protocol in our case is neither HTTP nor HTTPs; our `index.html` is a local file and accessed as such. In our case, this URL would be expanded tofile:///s3.amazonaws.com.... So if you want your Web app to work on the desktop, avoid protocol-relative URLs. To fix this line, you would need to have something like the following:\n\n```javascript\nclippy.BASE_PATH = (window.location.protocol === \'file:\' ? \'https:\' : window.location.protocol) + \'//s3.amazonaws.com/clippy.js/Agents/\';\n```\n\nSo, after I updated this in my fork of ClippyJS, I re-ran the `npm install` command and re-launched the app.\n\n### Think outside the box\n\nIt could be prettier though right? Let’s start by making the window a bit smaller, removing the frame, and removing the toolbar (the search bar, etc.). Add the following to the app manifest:\n\n```javascript\n"window": {\n  "frame": false,\n  "toolbar": false,\n  "width": 300,\n  "height": 300\n}\n```\n\nThat’s it.\n\nAlthough if you’re on Mac OS X you’ll notice there’s a [weird bug](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/3645) where the window title is still shown. To workaround this, we can give the window a dummy title. We only want to do this if the app is running on Mac though, so let’s use Node.js’ core `os` module to detect the platform. Adding this to our `script.js` should be enough to solve the problem:\n\n```javascript\nvar isMac = require(\'os\').platform() === \'darwin\';\n\nif (isMac) {\n    document.title = \'\\u3000\'; // to get around https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/3645\n}\n```\n\n:::figure resurrecting-clippy/frameless.png The frameless app.\n:::\n\nOk, it’s better but let’s ditch that background.\n\nTransparency\n\nLet’s go back to our manifest and add a `transparent` property inside `window`;\n\n```javascript\n"window": {\n  "frame": false,\n  "toolbar": false,\n  "width": 300,\n  "height": 300,\n  "transparent": true\n}\n```\n\nThis gives the app the _ability_ to be transparent, but doesn’t make it transparent. This can be toggled programmatically as well. Note: depending on the platform, you may need to jump through some extra hoops, see [Transparency and NW.js](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/transparency-and-nwjs). All that’s left is to make sure your elements are not\n\nAll that’s left is to make sure your elements are not opague; for example:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  background: transparent;\n}\n```\n\n### Dragging\n\nWe no longer have a window title bar so we can’t drag it around anymore. CSS to the rescue, again!\n\n```css\nbody {\n  -webkit-app-region: drag;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can drag the app by clicking and holding anywhere on the `body`.\n\nUnfortunately, double-clicking a draggable area triggers the window to maximize on some platforms. So what we’ll do is tell the user that double clicking will close clippy.desktop, thanks to clippy.js’ `agent.speak` method which shows a speech bubble. Just to annoy the user even more, we won’t. Instead, Clippy will disappear and reappear again after a couple of seconds. This is done in the `clippy.load` callback:\n\n```javascript\n// show clippy\nclippy.load(\'Clippy\', function(agent){\n    agent.show();\n    var intiialSpeechTimeoutId = setTimeout(function() {\n        agent.speak("Need some help closing me? Try double-clicking...");\n    }, 20000);\n\n    var windowX = null;\n    var windowY = null;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        windowX = win.x;\n        windowY = win.y;\n    }, 250);\n\n    // ...\n\n    // Since double-clicking draggable areas triggers maximizing on some platforms, when tell the user double-clicking\n    // closes clippy but actually we\'ll hide the window, unmaximize, resize back to the normal size and show again\n    // with a speech bubble\n    win.on(\'maximize\', function(){\n        document.body.classList.add(\'hidden\');\n        win.hide();\n        if(intiialSpeechTimeoutId) {\n            clearTimeout(intiialSpeechTimeoutId);\n            intiialSpeechTimeoutId = null;\n        }\n\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            win.unmaximize();\n            win.resizeTo(gui.App.manifest.window.width, gui.App.manifest.window.height);\n            win.moveTo(windowX, windowY);\n        }, 250);\n\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            win.show();\n            document.body.classList.remove(\'hidden\');\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                agent.speak("Need some help?");\n            }, 500);\n        }, 2000);\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Events\n\nSpeaking of clicking, we also block clippy.js from adding any event handlers itself with jQuery;\n\n```javascript\n$.fn.on = function(){};\n```\n\nThis is before `clippy.load` is called. We want to handle clicks and everything else ourselves.\n\nAnimating Clippy on click should be easy right? You might not be aware but if a window is not focused on Mac OS X, the first click focuses the window and the second click actually clicks the element. This is expected behavior on Mac OS X. Note: This is why you never create HTML window controls and bars when using NW.js or Electron, as it would take two clicks to minimize a window for example.\n\nThis is why I use the window’s `focus` event instead. Whenever the window is focused, I trigger an animation and blur the window.\n\n```javascript\n// to be safe: use focus as a click handler kinda, to trigger animations. Blur when done so every click triggers\n// an animation\nwin.on(‘focus’, function() {\n  agent.animate();\n  win.blur();\n});\n```\n\nNote: Cross-platform support for blurring isn’t 100% solid so it’s best to just trigger an animation every once in awhile anyway as well.\n\n### I see you have no internet connection\n\nIf you’re offline, clippy.desktop doesn’t show anything. Why? Let’s take a look at the line in clippy.js again:\n\n```javascript\nclippy.BASE_PATH = (window.location.protocol === ‘file:’ ? ‘https:’ : window.location.protocol) + ‘//s3.amazonaws.com/clippy.js/Agents/’;\n```\n\nWhy is it doing anything at all with URLs? I’m not sure why it wasn’t bundled into one script but ClippyJS requests additional (remote) scripts from within the base clippy.js script. This doesn’t make sense for a desktop app.\n\n![](/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/mental.png)\n\n### Mental mode\n\nThis is where you come in. This implementation is just a start. Feel free to [improve it in a pull-request](https://github.com/teamwork/clippy.desktop). After all, it’s just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I’m not suggesting that you add a mode which makes Clippy disappear on `mouseover`, reappear elsewhere, jump around the place, driving the user insane. Definitely not.\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- It’s easy to make a desktop (Web) app with NW.js.\n- You can access all of Node.js, its module system and npm.\n- Don’t use protocol-less URIs.\n- Be aware of how Mac OS X treats clicks on unfocused windows.\n- Make sure your app works offline.\n- Have fun.\n',unfilteredRenderedBody:'<h2><a id="resurrecting-clippy" class="post-header-anchor" href="#resurrecting-clippy" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Resurrecting Clippy</h2>\n<p><img src="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/osx.png" alt="Clippy on Mac OS X"></p>\n<p>Remember Clippy? First shipped with Windows 97, Clippy was a “smart” assistant for Microsoft Office. A selfless shape-shifting paperclip who would appear out of nowhere to help you in any way it could. And how did you treat Clippy? Yeah, you should be ashamed of yourself. You either loved or hated Clippy. <strong>Spoiler</strong>: after a lot of backlash, Microsoft secretly ran a smear campaign against its own little paperclip, including an anti-Clippy Website, a “Kill Clippy” game, and more. <em>“I see you’re trying to destroy me, would you like help with that?”</em> Clippy said. Eventually retiring Clippy to fanfare, Microsoft masterfully spun your anger into positive press. Shame on all of you.</p>\n<p>I’m sure you’ve only recently stopped having guilt-ridden nightmares of a dancing paperclip, but I’ve good news. I’ve made a desktop application which not only brings Clippy back to Windows, but introduces Mac and Linux users to 90’s Siri too! Clippy.desktop is available for download at <a href="https://teamwork.github.io/clippy.desktop" rel="noopener">teamwork.github.io/clippy.desktop</a>.</p>\n<p>Why? Because I can. There’s just something satisfying about seeing Clippy on Windows 10 or El Capitan. It wasn’t even hard; I feel like an imposter for simply throwing together a few open-source things, so I’m going to use this an opportunity to share how easy it is to make a desktop app with NW.js (and a few pitfalls). For extra measure, here’s an embarrassing photo of me as a child:</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/embarrassing.jpg"><img src="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/embarrassing.jpg" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Look at those curls.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><h3><a id="desktop-web-apps" class="post-header-anchor" href="#desktop-web-apps" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Desktop (Web) apps</h3>\n<p>Quickly moving on, <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> was an obvious choice to make the app as we built the <a href="https://teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">Teamwork Chat</a> desktop apps with it. NW.js, along with the trendier <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a>, combines Chromium and Node.js to allow you to create a desktop application from a Web application. So the resultant executable is a standalone appplication just like Chrome which has access to all of the Node.js API as well. It’s great.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take long to get up and running either. You technically don’t need Node.js to develop an NW.js app, but I’ll assume you have it. First, grab the offical npm package; run <code>npm install -g nw</code> to make it available from anywhere on your machine. In a new directory named <code>clippy-desktop</code>, create a HTML file with whatever content you\'d like. All we need now is an &quot;app manifest&quot;; run <code>npm init</code> and follow the steps the generate one. Enter the name of your HTML file when asked for the <code>main</code> file. Why <code>npm init</code>? The app manifest is basically the same as any npm module\'s <code>package.json</code> (where its dependencies are listed, and so on.). So, now you have a basic manifest looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token string">"name"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"clippy-desktop"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"version"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"0.0.1"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"index.html"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"dependencies"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, run <code>nw clippy-desktop</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/running.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/running.png" alt=""/></a>\n          \n        </figure><p>Ta-da!

All credit to <a href="https://www.smore.com" rel="noopener">Smore</a> for creating a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of clippy <strong>in a weekend</strong>; <a href="https://www.smore.com/clippy-js" rel="noopener">ClippyJS</a> is impressive! Let’s use it in our app.</p>\n<p>Smore recommend downloading the CSS and JavaScript files from the ClippyJS GitHub repository, but let’s use this as an oppurtunity to learn how using dependencies from npm works. npm is Node.js’ package manager we used earlier to install <code>nw</code>. ClippyJS isn\'t on npm (yet) but it is on GitHub and npm allows us to install it straight from GitHub by running <code>npm install --save smore-inc/clippy.js</code>. That would work but if the ClippyJS repository wasn\'t missing the manifest every Node.js module needs. So I\'ve forked the ClippyJS repository and added the <code>package.json</code> (note that I\'ve added jQuery under <code>dependencies</code>). Now, running <code>npm install --save adam-lynch/clippy.js#pkg</code> will install ClippyJS into <code>clippy-desktop/node_modules</code>. To include ClippyJS we have to reference the CSS and JavaScript files just like we would in any Web app, adding <code>&lt;link href=&quot;node_modules/clippy.js/build/clippy.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script src=&quot;node_modules/clippy.js/build/clippy.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to the correct files.</p>\n<p>Note: Just in case you’ve noticed that Clippy.desktop’s <code>index.html</code> doesn\'t reference each file like I\'ve just said; I\'ve combined the dependencies into <code>third-party.js</code> just to make it cleaner, similarly to what\'s described in <a href="https://adamlynch.com/hassle-free-third-party-dependencies/" rel="noopener">Hassle-free third-party dependencies</a>.</p>\n<p>The ClippyJS site says we’ll need to programatically show Clippy ourselves, so let’s create a <code>script.js</code> with the following contents:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">clippy<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'Clippy\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>agent<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    agent<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">show</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>To resurrect Clippy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you’ve added a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> linking to your <code>script.js</code>.</li>\n<li>Kill the running app.</li>\n<li>Run <code>nw clippy-desktop</code> again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id="what-now" class="post-header-anchor" href="#what-now" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>What now?!</h3>\n<p>Huh.

See that the URL begins with <code>//</code> That\'s a <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/" rel="noopener">protocol-relative URL</a>, i.e. if the current site was accessed over HTTPS, HTTPS will be used as the protocol when requesting this URL, or HTTP if the site was accessed over HTTP. But the protocol in our case is neither HTTP nor HTTPs; our <code>index.html</code> is a local file and accessed as such. In our case, this URL would be expanded tofile:///s3.amazonaws.com.... So if you want your Web app to work on the desktop, avoid protocol-relative URLs. To fix this line, you would need to have something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">clippy<span class="token punctuation">.</span>BASE_PATH <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>window<span class="token punctuation">.</span>location<span class="token punctuation">.</span>protocol <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">\'file:\'</span> <span class="token operator">?</span> <span class="token string">\'https:\'</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> window<span class="token punctuation">.</span>location<span class="token punctuation">.</span>protocol<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\'//s3.amazonaws.com/clippy.js/Agents/\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, after I updated this in my fork of ClippyJS, I re-ran the <code>npm install</code> command and re-launched the app.</p>\n<h3><a id="think-outside-the-box" class="post-header-anchor" href="#think-outside-the-box" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Think outside the box</h3>\n<p>It could be prettier though right?

You either loved or hated Clippy. <strong>Spoiler</strong>: after a lot of backlash, Microsoft secretly ran a smear campaign against its own little paperclip, including an anti-Clippy Website, a “Kill Clippy” game, and more. <em>“I see you’re trying to destroy me, would you like help with that?”</em> Clippy said. Eventually retiring Clippy to fanfare, Microsoft masterfully spun your anger into positive press.

I’ve made a desktop application which not only brings Clippy back to Windows, but introduces Mac and Linux users to 90’s Siri too! Clippy.desktop is available for download at <a href="https://teamwork.github.io/clippy.desktop" rel="noopener">teamwork.github.io/clippy.desktop</a>.</p>\n<p>Why? Because I can. There’s just something satisfying about seeing Clippy on Windows 10 or El Capitan. It wasn’t even hard; I feel like an imposter for simply throwing together a few open-source things, so I’m going to use this an opportunity to share how easy it is to make a desktop app with NW.js (and a few pitfalls). For extra measure, here’s an embarrassing photo of me as a child:</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/embarrassing.jpg"><img src="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/embarrassing.jpg" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Look at those curls.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><h3><a id="desktop-web-apps" class="post-header-anchor" href="#desktop-web-apps" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Desktop (Web) apps</h3>\n<p>Quickly moving on, <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> was an obvious choice to make the app as we built the <a href="https://teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">Teamwork Chat</a> desktop apps with it. NW.js, along with the trendier <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a>, combines Chromium and Node.js to allow you to create a desktop application from a Web application. So the resultant executable is a standalone appplication just like Chrome which has access to all of the Node.js API as well. It’s great.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take long to get up and running either. You technically don’t need Node.js to develop an NW.js app, but I’ll assume you have it. First, grab the offical npm package; run <code>npm install -g nw</code> to make it available from anywhere on your machine. In a new directory named <code>clippy-desktop</code>, create a HTML file with whatever content you\'d like. All we need now is an &quot;app manifest&quot;; run <code>npm init</code> and follow the steps the generate one. Enter the name of your HTML file when asked for the <code>main</code> file. Why <code>npm init</code>? The app manifest is basically the same as any npm module\'s <code>package.json</code> (where its dependencies are listed, and so on.). So, now you have a basic manifest looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token string">"name"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"clippy-desktop"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"version"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"0.0.1"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"index.html"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"dependencies"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, run <code>nw clippy-desktop</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/running.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/resurrecting-clippy/running.png" alt=""/></a>\n          \n        </figure><p>Ta-da!

All credit to <a href="https://www.smore.com" rel="noopener">Smore</a> for creating a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of clippy <strong>in a weekend</strong>; <a href="https://www.smore.com/clippy-js" rel="noopener">ClippyJS</a> is impressive! Let’s use it in our app.</p>\n<p>Smore recommend downloading the CSS and JavaScript files from the ClippyJS GitHub repository, but let’s use this as an oppurtunity to learn how using dependencies from npm works. npm is Node.js’ package manager we used earlier to install <code>nw</code>. ClippyJS isn\'t on npm (yet) but it is on GitHub and npm allows us to install it straight from GitHub by running <code>npm install --save smore-inc/clippy.js</code>. That would work but if the ClippyJS repository wasn\'t missing the manifest every Node.js module needs. So I\'ve forked the ClippyJS repository and added the <code>package.json</code> (note that I\'ve added jQuery under <code>dependencies</code>). Now, running <code>npm install --save adam-lynch/clippy.js#pkg</code> will install ClippyJS into <code>clippy-desktop/node_modules</code>. To include ClippyJS we have to reference the CSS and JavaScript files just like we would in any Web app, adding <code>&lt;link href=&quot;node_modules/clippy.js/build/clippy.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script src=&quot;node_modules/clippy.js/build/clippy.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to the correct files.</p>\n<p>Note: Just in case you’ve noticed that Clippy.desktop’s <code>index.html</code> doesn\'t reference each file like I\'ve just said; I\'ve combined the dependencies into <code>third-party.js</code> just to make it cleaner, similarly to what\'s described in <a href="https://adamlynch.com/hassle-free-third-party-dependencies/" rel="noopener">Hassle-free third-party dependencies</a>.</p>\n<p>The ClippyJS site says we’ll need to programatically show Clippy ourselves, so let’s create a <code>script.js</code> with the following contents:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">clippy<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'Clippy\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>agent<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    agent<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">show</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>To resurrect Clippy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you’ve added a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> linking to your <code>script.js</code>.</li>\n<li>Kill the running app.</li>\n<li>Run <code>nw clippy-desktop</code> again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id="what-now" class="post-header-anchor" href="#what-now" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>What now?!</h3>\n<p>Huh.

See that the URL begins with <code>//</code> That\'s a <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/" rel="noopener">protocol-relative URL</a>, i.e. if the current site was accessed over HTTPS, HTTPS will be used as the protocol when requesting this URL, or HTTP if the site was accessed over HTTP. But the protocol in our case is neither HTTP nor HTTPs; our <code>index.html</code> is a local file and accessed as such. In our case, this URL would be expanded tofile:///s3.amazonaws.com.... So if you want your Web app to work on the desktop, avoid protocol-relative URLs. To fix this line, you would need to have something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">clippy<span class="token punctuation">.</span>BASE_PATH <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>window<span class="token punctuation">.</span>location<span class="token punctuation">.</span>protocol <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">\'file:\'</span> <span class="token operator">?</span> <span class="token string">\'https:\'</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> window<span class="token punctuation">.</span>location<span class="token punctuation">.</span>protocol<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\'//s3.amazonaws.com/clippy.js/Agents/\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, after I updated this in my fork of ClippyJS, I re-ran the <code>npm install</code> command and re-launched the app.</p>\n<h3><a id="think-outside-the-box" class="post-header-anchor" href="#think-outside-the-box" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Think outside the box</h3>\n<p>It could be prettier though right?

I love the web. I love how altruistic our community is, how it embraces open-source, testing and pushing the envelope. I love discovering beautiful websites and powerful apps. When I was first tasked with creating a desktop app, I was apprehensive and intimidated. It seemed like it would be difficult, or at least… different.\n\n:::\n\nIt’s not an attractive prospect, right? Would you have to learn a new language or three? Imagine an archaic, alien workflow, with ancient tooling, and none of those things you love about the web. How would your career be affected?\n\nOK, take a breath. The reality is that, as a web developer, not only do you already possess all of the skills to make great modern desktop apps, but thanks to powerful new APIs at your disposal, the desktop is actually where your skills can be leveraged the most.\n\nIn this article, we’ll look at the development of desktop applications using [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), the ups and downs of building one and living with one, using one code base for the desktop and the web, and more.\n\n### Why?\n\nFirst of all, why would anyone create a desktop app? Any existing web app (as opposed to a website, if you believe in the distinction) is probably suited to becoming a desktop app. You could build a desktop app around any web app that would benefit from integration in the user’s system; think native notifications, launching on startup, interacting with files, etc. Some users simply prefer having certain apps there permanently on their machine, accessible whether they have a connection or not.\n\nMaybe you’ve an idea that would only work as a desktop app; some things simply aren’t possible with a web app (at least yet, but more about that in a little bit). You could create a self-contained utility app for internal company use, without requiring anyone to install anything other than your app (because Node.js in built-in). Maybe you’ve an idea for the Mac App Store. Maybe it would simply be a fun side project.\n\nIt’s hard to sum up why you should consider creating a desktop app because there are so many kinds of apps you could create. It really depends on what you’d like to achieve, how advantageous you find the additional APIs, and how much offline usage would enhance the experience for your users. For my team, it was a no-brainer because we were building a [chat application](https://teamwork.com/chat). On the other hand, a connection-dependent desktop app that doesn’t really have any desktop integration should be a web app and a web app alone. It wouldn’t be fair to expect a user to download your app (which includes a browser of its own and Node.js) when they wouldn’t get any more value from it than from visiting a URL of yours in their favorite browser.\n\nInstead of describing the desktop app you personally should build and why, I’m hoping to spark an idea or at least spark your interest in this article. Read on to see just how easy it is to create powerful desktop apps using web technology and what that can afford you over (or alongside of) creating a web app.\n\n### NW.js\n\nDesktop applications have been around a long time but you don’t have all day, so let’s skip some history and begin in Shanghai, 2011. Roger Wang, of Intel’s Open Source Technology Center, created node-webkit; a proof-of-concept Node.js module that allowed the user to spawn a WebKit browser window and use Node.js modules within `<script>` tags.\n\nAfter some progress and a switch from WebKit to Chromium (the open-source project Google Chrome is based on), an intern named Cheng Zhao joined the project. It was soon realized that an app runtime based on Node.js and Chromium would make a nice framework for building desktop apps. The project went on be quite popular.\n\n*Note*: node-webkit was later renamed NW.js to make it a bit more generic because it no longer used Node.js or WebKit. Instead of Node.js, it was based on io.js (the Node.js fork) at the time, and Chromium had moved on from WebKit to its own fork, Blink.\n\nSo, if you were to download an NW.js app, you would actually be downloading Chromium, plus Node.js, plus the actual app code. Not only does this mean a desktop app can be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the app would also have access to all of the Node.js APIs (to read and write to disk, for example), and the end user wouldn’t know any better. That’s pretty powerful, but how does it work? Well, first let’s take a look at Chromium.\n\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/chromiumDiagram.png A rough diagram of Chromium\'s internals. (Note: this diagram is intentionally very simple; it\'s a lot more complex than this.)\n:::\n\nThere is a main background process, and each tab gets its own process. You might have seen that Google Chrome always has at least two processes in Windows\' task manager or macOS\' activity monitor. I haven\'t even attempted to arrange the contents of the main process here, but it contains the Blink rendering engine, the V8 JavaScript engine (which is what Node.js is built on, too, by the way) and some platform APIs that abstract native APIs. Each isolated tab or renderer process has access to the JavaScript engine, CSS parser and so on, but it is completely separate to the main process for fault tolerance. Renderer processes interact with the main process through interprocess communication (IPC).\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/nwjsDiagram.png A rough diagram of an NW.js app\'s internals.\n:::\n\nThis is roughly what an NW.js app looks like. It’s basically the same, except that each window has access to Node.js now as well. So, you have access to the DOM and you can require other scripts, node modules you’ve installed from npm, or built-in modules provided by NW.js. By default, your app has one window, and from there you can spawn other windows.\n\nCreating an app is really easy. All you need is an HTML file and a `package.json`, like you would have when working with Node.js. You can create a default one by running `npm init --yes`. Typically, a `package.json` would point a JavaScript file as the “main” file for the module (i.e. using the `main` property), but with NW.js you need to edit the `main` property to point to your HTML file.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  "name": "example-app",\n  "version": "1.0.0",\n  "description": "",\n  "main": "index.html",\n  "scripts": {\n    "test": "echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" && exit 1"\n  },\n  "keywords": [],\n  "author": "",\n  "license": "ISC"\n}\n```\n\n```markup\n\x3c!-- index.html --\x3e\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Example app</title>\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nOnce you install the official `nw` package from npm (by running `npm install -g nw`), you can run `nw .` within the project directory to launch your app.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/nwjsHelloWorld.png A screenshot of our example NW.js app.\n:::\n\nIt’s as easy as that. So, what happened here was that NW.js opened the initial window, loading your HTML file. I know this doesn’t look like much, but it’s up to you add some markup and styles, just like you would in a web app.\n\nYou could drop the window bar and chrome if you like, or create your own custom frame. You could have semi to fully transparent windows, hidden windows and more. I took this a bit further recently and [resurrected Clippy](http://adamlynch.com/resurrecting-clippy/) using NW.js. There’s something weirdly satisfying about seeing Clippy on macOS or Windows 10.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/clippy.png A screenshot of clippy.desktop on macOS.\n:::\n\nSo, you get to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can use Node.js to read and write to disk, execute system commands, spawn other executables and more. Hypothetically, you could build a multiplayer roulette game over WebRTC that deletes some of the users\' files randomly, if you wanted.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/moduleCounts.png Bar graph showing the number of modules per major package manager. (Source: [Module Counts](http://modulecounts.com))\n:::\n\nYou get access not only to Node.js’ APIs but to all of npm, which has over 350,000 modules now. For example, [auto-launch](https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch) is an open-source module we created at [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/) to launch an NW.js or Electron app on startup.\n\nNode.js also has what’s known as “native modules,” which, if you really need to do something a bit lower level, allows you to create modules in C or C++.\n\nTo top it all off, NW.js exposes APIs that effectively wrap native APIs, allowing you to integrate closely with the desktop environment. You can have a tray icon, open a file or URL in the default system application, and a lot lot more. All you need to do to trigger a notification is use the HTML5 notification API:\n\n```javascript\nnew Notification(\'Hello\', {\n  body: \'world\'\n});\n```\n\n### Electron\n\nYou might recognize GitHub’s text editor, Atom, below. Whether you use it or not, Atom was a game-changer for desktop apps. GitHub started development of Atom in 2013, soon recruited Cheng Zhao, and forked node-webkit as its base, which it later open-sourced under the name atom-shell.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/atom.png A screenshot of Atom, GitHub\'s text editor.\n:::\n\n*Note*: It’s disputed whether Electron is a fork of node-webkit or whether everything was rewritten from scratch. Either way, it’s effectively a fork for the end user because the APIs were almost identical.\n\nIn making Atom, GitHub improved on the formula and ironed out a lot of the bugs. In 2015, atom-shell was renamed Electron. Since then it has hit version 1.0, and with GitHub pushing it, it has really taken off.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/logos.png Logos of projects that use Electron.\n:::\n\nAs well as Atom, other notable projects built with Electron include Slack, Visual Studio Code, Brave, HyperTerm and Nylas, which is really doing some cutting-edge stuff with it. Mozilla Tofino is an interesting one, too. It was an internal project at Mozilla (the company behind Firefox), with the aim of radically improving web browsers. Yeah, a team within Mozilla chose Electron (which is based on Chromium) for this experiment.\n\n### How Does It Differ?\n\nBut how is it different from NW.js? First of all, Electron is less browser-oriented than NW.js. The entry point for an Electron app is a script that runs in the main process.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/electronDiagram.png A rough diagram of an Electron app\'s internals.\n:::\n\nThe Electron team patched Chromium to allow for the embedding of multiple JavaScript engines that could run at the same time. So, when Chromium releases a new version, they don’t have to do anything.\n\n_Note_: NW.js hooks into Chromium a little differently, and this was often blamed on the fact NW.js wasn’t quite as good at keeping up with Chromium as Electron was. However, throughout 2016, NW.js has released a new version within 24 hours of each major Chromium release, which the team attributes to an organizational shift.\n\nBack to the main process. Your app hasn’t any window by default, but you can open as many windows as you’d like from the main process, each having its own renderer process, just like NW.js.\n\nSo, yeah, the minimum you need for an Electron app is a main JavaScript file (which we’ll leave empty for now) and a `package.json` that points to it. Then, all you need to do is `npm install --save-dev electron` and run `electron .` to launch your app.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  "name": "example-app",\n  "version": "1.0.0",\n  "description": "",\n  "main": "main.js",\n  "scripts": {\n    "test": "echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" && exit 1"\n  },\n  "keywords": [],\n  "author": "",\n  "license": "ISC"\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// main.js, which is empty\n```\n\nNot much will happen, though, because your app hasn’t any window by default. You can open as many windows as you’d like from the main process, each having its own renderer process, just like they’d have in an NW.js app.\n\n```javascript\n// main.js\nconst {app, BrowserWindow} = require(\'electron\');\nlet mainWindow;\n\napp.on(\'ready\', () => {\n  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 500,\n    height: 400\n  });\n  mainWindow.loadURL(\'file://\' + __dirname + \'/index.html\');\n});\n```\n\n```markup\n\x3c!-- index.html --\x3e\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Example app</title>\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nYou could load a remote URL in this window, but typically you’d create a local HTML file and load that. Ta-da!\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/electronHelloWorld.png A screenshot of our example Electron app.\n:::\n\nOf the built-in modules Electron provides, like the `app` or `BrowserWindow` module used in the previous example, most can only be used in either the main or a renderer process. For example, the main process is where, and only where, you can manage your windows, automatic updates and more. You might want a click of a button to trigger something in your main process, though, so Electron comes with built-in methods for IPC. You can basically emit arbitrary events and listen for them on the other side. In this case, you’d catch the `click` event in the renderer process, emit an event over IPC to the main process, catch it in the main process and finally perform the action.\n\nOK, so Electron has distinct processes, and you have to organize your app slightly differently, but that’s not a big deal. Why are people using Electron instead of NW.js? Well, there’s mindshare. So many related tools and modules are out there as a result of its popularity. The documentation is better. Most importantly, it has fewer bugs and superior APIs.\n\nElectron’s documentation really is amazing, though — that’s worth emphasizing. Take the [Electron API Demos app](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos). It’s an Electron app that interactively demonstrates what you can do with Electron’s APIs. Not only is the API described and sample code provided for creating a new window, for example, but clicking a button will actually execute the code and a new window will open.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/apiDemosApp.png A screenshot of the Electron API Demos app.\n:::\n\nIf you submit an issue via Electron’s bug tracker, you’ll get a response within a couple of days. I’ve seen three-year-old NW.js bugs, although I don’t hold it against them. It’s tough when an open-source project is written in languages drastically different from the languages known by its users. NW.js and Electron are written mostly in C++ (and a tiny bit of Objective C++) but used by people who write JavaScript. I’m extremely grateful for what NW.js has given us.\n\nElectron ironed out a few of the flaws in the NW.js APIs. For example, you can bind global keyboard shortcuts, which would be caught even if your app isn’t focused. An example API flaw I ran into was that binding to `Control + Shift + A` in an NW.js app did what you would expect on Windows, but actually bound to `Command + Shift + A` on a Mac. This was intentional but really weird. There was no way to bind to the `Control` key. Also, binding to the `Command` key did bind to the `Command` key but the `Windows` key on Windows and Linux as well. The Electron team spotted these problems (when adding shortcuts to Atom I assume) and quickly updated their globalShortcut API so both of these cases work as you’d expect. To be fair, NW.js has since fixed the former but not the latter.\n\nThere are a few other differences. For instance, in recent NW.js versions, notifications that were previously native are now Chrome-style ones. These don’t go into the notification centre on Mac OS X or Windows 10, but there are modules on npm that you could use as a workaround if you’d like. If you want to do something interesting with audio or video, use Electron, because some codecs don’t work out of the box with NW.js.\n\nElectron has added a few new APIs as well, more desktop integration, and it has built-in support for automatic updates, but I’ll cover that later.\n\n### But How Does It Feel?\n\nIt feels fine. Sure, it’s not native. Most desktop apps these days don’t look like Windows Explorer or Finder anyway, so users won’t mind or realize that HTML is behind your user interface. You can make it feel more native if you’d like, but I’m not convinced it will make the experience any better. For example, you could prevent the cursor from turning to a hand when the user hovers over a button. That’s how a native desktop app would act, but is that better? There are also projects out there like [Photon Kit](http://photonkit.com/), which is basically a CSS framework like Bootstrap, but for macOS-style components.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/photon.png A screenshot of an example Electron app made with Photon.\n:::\n\n### Performance\n\nWhat about performance? Is it slow or laggy? Well, your app is essentially a web app. It’ll perform pretty much like a web app in Google Chrome. You can create a performant app or a sluggish one, but that’s fine because you already have the skills to analyze and improve performance. One of the best things about your app being based on Chromium is that you get its DevTools. You can debug within the app or remotely, and the Electron team has even created a DevTools extension named [Devtron](http://electron.atom.io/devtron/) to monitor some Electron-specific stuff.\n\nYour desktop app can be more performant than a web app, though. One thing you could do is create a worker window, a hidden window that you use to perform any expensive work. Because it’s an isolated process, any computation or processing going on in that window won’t affect rendering, scrolling or anything else in your visible window(s).\n\nKeep in mind that you can always spawn system commands, spawn executables or drop down to native code if you really need to (you won’t).\n\n### Distribution\n\nBoth NW.js and Electron support a wide array of platforms, including Windows, Mac and Linux. Electron doesn’t support Windows XP or Vista; NW.js does. Getting an NW.js app into the Mac App Store is a bit tricky; you’ll have to jump through a few hoops. Electron, on the other hand, comes with Mac App Store-compatible builds, which are just like the normal builds except that you don’t have access to some modules, such as the auto-updater module (which is fine because your app will update via the Mac App Store anyway).\n\nElectron even supports ARM builds, so your app can run on a Chromebook or Raspberry Pi. Finally, Google may be [phasing out Chrome Packaged Apps](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html), but NW.js allows you to port an app over to an NW.js app and still have access the same Chromium APIs.\n\nEven though 32-bit and 64-bit builds are supported, you’ll get away with 64-bit Mac and Windows apps. You will need 32-bit and 64-bit Linux apps, though, for compatibility.\n\nSo, let’s say that Electron has won over and you want to ship an Electron app. There’s a nice Node.js module named [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) that helps with packing your app up into an `.app` or `.exe` file. A few similar projects exist, including interactive ones that prompt you step by step. You should use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder), though, which builds on top of electron-packager, plus a few other related modules. It generates `.dmg`s and Windows installers and takes care of the code-signing of your app for you. This is really important. Without it, your app would be labelled as untrusted by operating systems, your app could trigger anti-virus software, and Microsoft SmartScreen might try to block the user from launching your app.\n\nThe annoying thing about code-signing is that you have to sign your app on a Mac for Mac and on Windows for Windows. So, if you’re serious about shipping desktop apps, then you’ll need to build on multiple machines for each release.\n\nThis can feel a bit too manual or tedious, especially if you’re used to creating for the web. Thankfully, electron-builder was created with automation in mind. I’m talking here about continuous integration tools and services such as [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [CodeShip](http://codeship.com/), [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) (for Windows) and so on. These could run your desktop app build at the press of a button or at every push to GitHub, for example.\n\n### Automatic Updates\n\nNW.js doesn’t have automatic update support, but you’ll have access to all of Node.js, so you can do whatever you want. Open-source modules are out there for it, such as [node-webkit-updater](https://github.com/edjafarov/node-webkit-updater), which handles downloading and replacing your app with a newer version. You could also roll your own custom system if you wanted.\n\nElectron has built-in support for automatic updates, via its [autoUpdater](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/auto-updater/) API. It doesn’t support Linux, first of all; instead, publishing your app to Linux package managers is recommended. This is common on Linux — don’t worry. The `autoUpdater` API is really simple; once you give it a URL, you can call the `checkForUpdates` method. It’s event-driven, so you can subscribe to the `update-downloaded` event, for example, and once it’s fired, call the `restartAndInstall` method to install the new version and restart the app. You can listen for a few other events, which you can use to tie the auto-updating functionality into your user interface nicely.\n\n_Note_: You can have multiple update channels if you want, such as Google Chrome and Google Chrome Canary.\n\nIt’s not quite as simple behind the API. It’s based on the Squirrel update framework, which differs drastically between Mac and Windows, which use the [Squirrel.Mac](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac) and [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) projects, respectively.\n\nThe update code within your Mac Electron app is simple, but you’ll need a server (albeit a simple server). When you call the autoUpdater module’s `checkForUpdates` method, it will hit your server. What your server needs to do is return a 204 (“No Content”) if there isn’t an update; and if there is, it needs to return a 200 with a JSON containing a URL pointing to a `.zip` file. Back under the hood of your app (or the client), Squirrel.Mac will know what to do. It’ll go get that `.zip`, unzip it and fire the appropriate events.\n\nThere a bit more (magic) going on in your Windows app when it comes to automatic updates. You won’t need a server, but you can have one if you’d like. You could host the static (update) files somewhere, such as AWS S3, or even have them locally on your machine, which is really handy for testing. Despite the differences between Squirrel.Mac and Squirrel.Windows, a happy medium can be found; for example, having a server for both, and storing the updates on S3 or somewhere similar.\n\nSquirrel.Windows has a couple of nice features over Squirrel.Mac as well. It applies updates in the background; so, when you call `restartAndInstall`, it’ll be a bit quicker because it’s ready and waiting. It also supports delta updates. Let’s say your app checks for updates and there is one newer version. A binary diff (between the currently installed app and the update) will be downloaded and applied as a patch to the current executable, instead of replacing it with a whole new app. It can even do that incrementally if you’re, say, three versions behind, but it will only do that if it’s worth it. Otherwise, if you’re, say, 15 versions behind, it will just download the latest version in its entirety instead. The great thing is that all of this is done under the hood for you. The API remains really simple. You check for updates, it will figure out the optimal method to apply the update, and it will let you know when it’s ready to go.\n\n_Note_: You will have to generate those binary diffs, though, and host them alongside your standard updates. Thankfully, electron-builder generates these for you, too.\n\nThanks to the Electron community, you don’t have to build your own server if you don’t want to. There are open-source projects you can use. Some allow you to [store updates on S3](https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server) or use [GitHub releases](https://github.com/GitbookIO/nuts), and some even go as far as [providing administrative dashboards](https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server) to manage the updates.\n\n### Desktop Versus Web\n\nSo, how does making a desktop app differ from making a web app? Let’s look at a few unexpected problems or gains you might come across along the way, some unexpected side effects of APIs you’re used to using on the web, workflow pain points, maintenance woes and more.\n\nWell, the first thing that comes to mind is browser lock-in. It’s like a guilty pleasure. If you’re making a desktop app exclusively, you’ll know exactly which Chromium version all of your users are on. Let your imagination run wild; you can use flexbox, ES6, pure WebSockets, WebRTC, anything you want. You can even enable experimental features in Chromium for your app (i.e. features coming down the line) or tweak settings such as your localStorage allowance. You’ll never have to deal with any cross-browser incompatibilities. This is on top of Node.js’ APIs and all of npm. You can do anything.\n\n_Note_: You’ll still have to consider which operating system the user is running sometimes, though, but OS-sniffing is a lot more reliable and less frowned upon than browser sniffing.\n\n#### Working With file://\n\nAnother interesting thing is that your app is essentially offline-first. Keep that in mind when creating your app; a user can launch your app without a network connection and your app will run; it will still load the local files. You’ll need to pay more attention to how your app behaves if the network connection is lost while it’s running. You may need to adjust your mindset.\n\n_Note_: You can load remote URLs if you really want, but I wouldn’t.\n\nOne tip I can give you here is not to trust [`navigator.onLine`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine) completely. This property returns a Boolean indicating whether or not there’s a connection, but watch out for false positives. It’ll return `true` if there’s any local connection without validating that connection. The Internet might not actually be accessible; it could be fooled by a dummy connection to a Vagrant virtual machine on your machine, etc. Instead, use Sindre Sorhus’ [`is-online`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-online) module to double-check; it will ping the Internet’s root servers and/or the favicon of a few popular websites. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst isOnline = require(\'is-online\');\n\nif(navigator.onLine){\n  // hmm there\'s a connection, but is the Internet accessible?\n  isOnline().then(online => {\n    console.log(online); // true or false\n  });\n}\nelse {\n  // we can trust navigator.onLine when it says there is no connection\n  console.log(false);\n}\n```\n\nSpeaking of local files, there are a few things to be aware of when using the `file://` protocol — protocol-less URLs, for one; you can’t use them anymore. I mean URLs that start with `//` instead of `http://` or `https://`. Typically, if a web app requests `//example.com/hello.json`, then your browser would expand this to `http://example.com/hello.json` or to `https://example.com/hello.json` if the current page is loaded over HTTPS. In our app, the current page would load using the `file://` protocol; so, if we requested the same URL, it would expand to `file://example.com/hello.json` and fail. The real worry here is third-party modules you might be using; authors aren’t thinking of desktop apps when they make a library.\n\nYou’d never use a CDN. Loading local files is basically instantaneous. There’s also no limit on the number of concurrent requests (per domain), like there is on the web (with HTTP/1.1 at least). You can load as many as you want in parallel.\n\n#### Artifacts Galore\n\nA lot of asset generation is involved in creating a solid desktop app. You’ll need to generate executables and installers and decide on an auto-update system. Then, for each update, you’ll have to build the executables again, more installers (because if someone goes to your website to download it, they should get the latest version) and binary diffs for delta updates.\n\nWeight is still a concern. A “Hello, World!” Electron app is 40 MB zipped. Besides the typical advice you follow when creating a web app (write less code, minify it, have fewer dependencies, etc.), there isn’t much I can offer you. The “Hello, World!” app is literally an app containing one HTML file; most of the weight comes from the fact that Chromium and Node.js are baked into your app. At least delta updates will reduce how much is downloaded when a user performs an update (on Windows only, I’m afraid). However, your users won’t be downloading your app on a 2G connection (hopefully!).\n\n#### Expect the Unexpected\n\nYou will discover unexpected behavior now and again. Some of it is more obvious than the rest, but a little annoying nonetheless. For example, let’s say you’ve made a music player app that supports a mini-player mode, in which the window is really small and always in front of any other apps. If a user were to click or tap a dropdown (`<select/>`), then it would open to reveal its options, overflowing past the bottom edge of the app. If you were to use a non-native select library (such as select2 or chosen), though, you’re in trouble. When open, your dropdown will be cut off by the edge of your app. So, the user would see a few items and then nothing, which is really frustrating. This would happen in a web browser, too, but it’s not often the user would resize the window down to a small enough size.\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/dropdownComparison.png Screenshots comparing what happens to a native dropdown versus a non-native one as they hit any edges of an app window.\n:::\n\nYou may or may not know it, but on a Mac, every window has a header and a body. When a window isn’t focused, if you hover over an icon or button in the header, its appearance will reflect the fact that it’s being hovered over. For example, the close button on macOS is gray when the window is blurred but red when you hover over it. However, if you move your mouse over something in the body of the window, there is no visible change. This is intentional. Think about your desktop app, though; it’s Chromium missing the header, and your app is the web page, which is the body of the window. You could drop the native frame and create your own custom HTML buttons instead for minimize, maximize and close. If your window isn’t focused, though, they won’t react if you were to hover over them. Hover styles won’t be applied, and that feels really wrong. To make it worse, if you were to click the close button, for example, it would focus the window and that’s it. A second click would be required to actually click the button and close the app.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Chromium has a bug that can mask the problem, making you think it works as you might have originally expected. If you move your mouse fast enough (nothing too unreasonable) from outside the window to an element inside the window, hover styles will be applied to that element. It’s a confirmed bug; applying the hover styles on a blurred window body “doesn’t meet platform expectations,” so it will be fixed. Hopefully, I’m saving you some heartbreak here. You could have a situation in which you’ve created beautiful custom window controls, yet in reality a lot of your users will be frustrated with your app (and will guess it’s not native).\n\nSo, you must use native buttons on a Mac. There’s no way around that. For an NW.js app, you must enable the native frame, which is the default anyway (you can disable it by setting `window` object’s `frame` property to `false` in your `package.json`).\n\nYou could do the same with an Electron app. This is controlled by setting the `frame` property when creating a window; for example, `new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, frame: true})`. As the Electron team does, they spotted this issue and added another option as a nice compromise; `titleBarStyle`. Setting this to `hidden` will hide the native title bar but keep the native window controls overlaid over the top-left corner of your app. This gets you around the problem of having non-native buttons on Mac, but you can still style the top of the app (and the area behind the buttons) however you like.\n\n```javascript\n// main.js\nconst {app, BrowserWindow} = require(\'electron\');\nlet mainWindow;\n\napp.on(\'ready\', () => {\n  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 500,\n    height: 400,\n    titleBarStyle: \'hidden\'\n  });\n  mainWindow.loadURL(\'file://\' + __dirname + \'/index.html\');\n});\n```\n\nHere’s an app in which I’ve disabled the title bar and given the `html` element a background image:\n\n:::figure beyond-the-browser/hiddenTitleBar.png A screenshot of our example app without the title bar.\n:::\n\nSee “[Frameless Window](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/frameless-window)” from Electron’s documentation for more.\n\n#### Tooling\n\nWell, you can pretty much use all of the tooling you’d use to create a web app. Your app is just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, right? Plenty of plugins and modules are out there specifically for desktop apps, too, such as Gulp plugins for signing your app, for example (if you didn’t want to use electron-builder). [Electron-connect](https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect) watches your files for changes, and when they occur, it’ll inject those changes into your open window(s) or relaunch the app if it was your main script that was modified. It is Node.js, after all; you can pretty much do anything you’d like. You could run webpack inside your app if you wanted to — I’ve no idea why you would, but the options are endless. Make sure to check out [awesome-electron](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron) for more resources.\n\n#### Release Flow\n\nWhat’s it like to maintain and live with a desktop app? First of all, the release flow is completely different. A significant mindset adjustment is required. When you’re working on the web app and you deploy a change that breaks something, it’s not really a huge deal (of course, that depends on your app and the bug). You can just roll out a fix. Users who reload or change the page and new users who trickle in will get the latest code. Developers under pressure might rush out a feature for a deadline and fix bugs as they’re reported or noticed. You can’t do that with desktop apps. You can’t take back updates you push out there. It’s more like a mobile app flow. You build the app, put it out there, and you can’t take it back. Some users might not even update from a buggy version to the fixed version. This will make you worry about all of the bugs out there in old versions.\n\n#### Quantum Mechanics\n\nBecause a host of different versions of your app are in use, your code will exist in multiple forms and states. Multiple variants of your client (desktop app) could be hitting your API in 10 slightly different ways. So, you’ll need to strongly consider versioning your API, really locking down and testing it well. When an API change is to be introduced, you might not be sure if it’s a breaking change or not. A version released a month ago could implode because it has some slightly different code.\n\n#### Fresh Problems to Solve\n\nYou might receive a few strange bug reports — ones that involve bizarre user account arrangements, specific antivirus software or worse. I had a case in which a user had installed something (or had done something themselves) that messed with their system’s environment variables. This broke our app because a dependency we used for something critical failed to execute a system command because the command could no longer be found. This is a good example because there will be occasions when you’ll have to draw a line. This was something critical to our app, so we couldn’t ignore the error, and we couldn’t fix their machine. For users like this, a lot of their desktop apps would be somewhat broken at best. In the end, we decided to show a tailored error screen to the user if this unlikely error were ever to pop up again. It links to a document explaining why it has occurred and has a step-by-step guide to fix it.\n\nSure, a few web-specific concerns are no longer applicable when you’re working on a desktop app, such as legacy browsers. You will have a few new ones to take into consideration, though. There’s a 256-character limit on file paths in Windows, for example.\n\nOld versions of npm store dependencies in a recursive file structure. Your dependencies would each get stored in their own directory within a `node_modules` directory in your project (for example, `node_modules/a`). If any of your dependencies have dependencies of their own, those grandchild dependencies would be stored in a `node_modules` within that directory (for example, `node_modules/a/node_modules/b`). Because Node.js and npm encourage small single-purpose modules, you could easily end up with a really long path, like `path/to/your/project/node_modules/a/node_modules/b/node_modules/c/.../n/index.js`.\n\n_Note_: Since version 3, npm flattens out the dependency tree as much as possible. However, there are other causes for long paths.\n\nWe had a case in which our app wouldn’t launch at all (or would crash soon after launching) on certain versions of Windows due to an exceeding long path. This was a major headache. With Electron, you can put all of your app’s code into an [asar archive](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/application-packaging/), which protects against path length issues but has exceptions and can’t always be used.\n\nWe created a little Gulp plugin named [gulp-path-length](https://github.com/Teamwork/gulp-path-length), which lets you know whether any dangerously long file paths are in your app. Where your app is stored on the end user’s machine will determine the true length of the path, though. In our case, our installer will install it to `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming`. So, when our app is built (locally by us or by a continuous integration service), gulp-path-length is instructed to audit our files as if they’re stored there (on the user’s machine with a long username, to be safe).\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require(\'gulp\');\nvar pathLength = require(\'gulp-path-length\');\n\ngulp.task(\'default\', function(){\n    gulp.src(\'./example/**/*\', {read: false})\n        .pipe(pathLength({\n\t        rewrite: {\n\t\t        match: \'./example\',\n\t\t        replacement: \'C:\\\\Users\\\\this-is-a-long-username\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Teamwork Chat\\\\\'\n\t        }\n        }));\n});\n```\n\n#### Fatal Errors Can Be Really Fatal\n\nBecause all of the automatic updates handling is done within the app, you could have an uncaught exception that crashes the app before it even gets to check for an update. Let’s say you discover the bug and release a new version containing a fix. If the user launches the app, an update would start downloading, and then the app would die. If they were to relaunch app, the update would start downloading again and… crash. So, you’d have to reach out to all of your users and let them know they’ll need to reinstall the app. Trust me, I know. It’s horrible.\n\n#### Analytics and Bug Reports\n\nYou’ll probably want to track usage of the app and any errors that occur. First of all, Google Analytics won’t work (out of the box, at least). You’ll have to find something that doesn’t mind an app that runs on `file://` URLs. If you’re using a tool to track errors, make sure to lock down errors by app version if the tool supports release-tracking. For example, if you’re using [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) to track errors, make sure to [set the `release` property when setting up your client](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/javascript/config/#optional-settings), so that errors will be split up by app version. Otherwise, if you receive a report about an error and roll out a fix, you’ll keep on receiving reports about the error, filling up your reports or logs with false positives. These errors will be coming from people using older versions.\n\nElectron has a [`crashReporter`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/crash-reporter/) module, which will send you a report any time the app completely crashes (i.e. the entire app dies, not for any old error thrown). You can also listen for events indicating that your renderer process has become unresponsive.\n\n#### Security\n\nBe extra-careful when accepting user input or even trusting third-party scripts, because a malicious individual could have a lot of fun with access to Node.js. Also, never accept user input and pass it to a native API or command without proper sanitation.\n\nDon’t trust code from vendors either. We had a problem recently with a third-party snippet we had included in our app for analytics, provided by company X. The team behind it rolled out an update with some dodgy code, thereby introducing a fatal error in our app. When a user launched our app, the snippet grabbed the newest JavaScript from their CDN and ran it. The error thrown prevented anything further from executing. Anyone with the app already running was unaffected, but if they were to quit it and launch it again, they’d have the problem, too. We contacted X’s support team and they promptly rolled out a fix. Our app was fine again once our users restarted it, but it was scary there for a while. We wouldn’t have been able to patch the problem ourselves without forcing affected users to manually download a new version of the app (with the snippet removed).\n\nHow can you mitigate this risk? You could try to catch errors, but you’ve no idea what they company X might do in its JavaScript, so you’re better off with something more solid. You could add a level of abstraction. Instead of pointing directly to X’s URL from your `<script>`, you could use [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.ie/analytics/tag-manager/) or your own API to return either HTML containing the `<script>` tags or a single JavaScript file containing all of your third-party dependencies somehow. This would enable you to change which snippets get loaded (by tweaking Google Tag Manager or your API endpoint) without having to roll out a new update.\n\nHowever, if the API no longer returned the analytics snippet, the global variable created by the snippet would still be there in your code, trying to call undefined functions. So, we haven’t solved the problem entirely. Also, this API call would fail if a user launches the app without a connection. You don’t want to restrict your app when offline. Sure, you could use a cached result from the last time the request succeeded, but what if there was a bug in that version? You’re back to the same problem.\n\nAnother solution would be to create a hidden window and load a (local) HTML file there that contains all of your third-party snippets. So, any global variables that the snippets create would be scoped to that window. Any errors thrown would be thrown in that window and your main window(s) would be unaffected. If you needed to use those APIs or global variables in your main window(s), you’d do this via IPC now. You’d send an event over IPC to your main process, which would then send it onto the hidden window, and if it was still healthy, it would listen for the event and call the third-party function. That would work.\n\nThis brings us back to security. What if someone malicious at company X were to include some dangerous Node.js code in their JavaScript? We’d be rightly screwed. Luckily, Electron has a nice option to disable Node.js for a given window, so it simply wouldn’t run:\n\n```javascript\n// main.js\nconst {app, BrowserWindow} = require(\'electron\');\nlet thirdPartyWindow;\n\napp.on(\'ready\', () => {\n  thirdPartyWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 500,\n    height: 400,\n    webPreferences: {\n      nodeIntegration: false\n    }\n  });\n  thirdPartyWindow.loadURL(\'file://\' + __dirname + \'/third-party-snippets.html\');\n});\n```\n\n#### Automated Testing\n\nNW.js doesn’t have any built-in support for testing. But, again, you have access to Node.js, so it’s technically possible. There is a way to test stuff such as button-clicking within the app using [Chrome Remote Interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface), but it’s tricky. Even then, you can’t trigger a click on a native window control and test what happens, for example.\n\nThe Electron team has created [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/) for automated testing, and it supports testing native controls, managing windows and simulating Electron events. It can even be run in continuous integration builds.\n\n```javascript\nvar Application = require(\'spectron\').Application\nvar assert = require(\'assert\')\n\ndescribe(\'application launch\', function () {\n  this.timeout(10000)\n\n  beforeEach(function () {\n    this.app = new Application({\n      path: \'/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp\'\n    })\n    return this.app.start()\n  })\n\n  afterEach(function () {\n    if (this.app && this.app.isRunning()) {\n      return this.app.stop()\n    }\n  })\n\n  it(\'shows an initial window\', function () {\n    return this.app.client.getWindowCount().then(function (count) {\n      assert.equal(count, 1)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nBecause your app is HTML, you could easily use any tool to test web apps, just by pointing the tool at your static files. However, in this case, you’d need to make sure the app can run in a web browser without Node.js.\n\n### Desktop And Web\n\nIt’s not necessarily about desktop or web. As a web developer, you have all of the tools required to make an app for either environment. Why not both? It takes a bit more effort, but it’s worth it. I’ll mention a few related topics and tools, which are complicated in their own right, so I’ll keep just touch on them.\n\nFirst of all, forget about “browser lock-in,” native WebSockets, etc. The same goes for ES6\\. You can either revert to writing plain old ES5 JavaScript or use something like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile your ES6 into ES5, for web use.\n\nYou also have `require`s throughout your code (for importing other scripts or modules), which a browser won’t understand. Use a module bundler that supports CommonJS (i.e. Node.js-style `require`s), such as [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org). When making a build for the web, a module bundler will run over your code, traverse all of the `require`s and bundle them up into one script for you.\n\nAny code using Node.js or Electron APIs (i.e. to write to disk or integrate with the desktop environment) should not be called when the app is running on the web. You can detect this by checking whether `process.version.nwjs` or `process.versions.electron` exists; if it does, then your app is currently running in the desktop environment.\n\nEven then, you’ll be loading a lot of redundant code in the web app. Let’s say you have a `require` guarded behind a check like `if(app.isInDesktop)`, along with a big chunk of desktop-specific code. Instead of detecting the environment at runtime and setting `app.isInDesktop`, you could pass `true` or `false` into your app as a flag at buildtime (for example, using the [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) transform for Browserify). This will aide your module bundler of choice when it’s doing its static analysis and tree-shaking (i.e. dead-code elimination). It will now know whether `app.isInDesktop` is `true`. So, if you’re running your web build, it won’t bother going inside that `if` statement or traversing the `require` in question.\n\n#### Continuous Delivery\n\nThere’s that release mindset again; it’s challenging. When you’re working on the web, you want to be able to roll out changes frequently. I believe in continually delivering small incremental changes that can be rolled back quickly. Ideally, with enough testing, an intern can push a little tweak to your master branch, resulting in your web app being automatically tested and deployed.\n\nAs we covered earlier, you can’t really do this with a desktop app. OK, I guess you technically could if you’re using Electron, because electron-builder can be automated and, so, can spectron tests. I don’t know anyone doing this, and I wouldn’t have enough faith to do it myself. Remember, broken code can’t be taken back, and you could break the update flow. Besides, you don’t want to deliver desktop updates too often anyway. Updates aren’t silent, like they are on the web, so it’s not very nice for the user. Plus, for users on macOS, delta updates aren’t supported, so users would be downloading a full new app for each release, no matter how small a tweak it has.\n\nYou’ll have to find a balance. A happy medium might be to release all fixes to the web as soon as possible and release a desktop app weekly or monthly — unless you’re releasing a feature, that is. You don’t want to punish a user because they chose to install your desktop app. Nothing’s worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realize that you’ll have to wait a while longer than everyone else. You could employ a feature-flags API to roll out features on both platforms at the same time, but that’s a whole separate topic. I first learned of feature flags from “[Continuous Delivery: The Dirty Details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY),” a talk by Etsy’s VP of Engineering, Mike Brittain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, there you have it. With minimal effort, you can add “desktop app developer” to your resumé. We’ve looked at creating your first modern desktop app, packaging, distribution, after-sales service and a lot more. Hopefully, despite the pitfalls and horror stories I’ve shared, you’ll agree that it’s not as scary as it seems. You already have what it takes. All you need to do is look over some API documentation. Thanks to a few new powerful APIs at your disposal, you can get the most value from your skills as a web developer. I hope to see you around (in the NW.js or Electron community) soon.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n*   “[Resurrecting Clippy](http://engineroom.teamwork.com/resurrecting-clippy/),” Adam Lynch (me)\n    How I built clippy.desktop with NW.js.\n*   “[Essential Electron](http://jlord.us/essential-electron/),” Jessica Lord\n    A plain-speak introduction to Electron and its core concepts.\n*   [Electron Documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/)\n    Want to dig into the details?

Any existing web app (as opposed to a website, if you believe in the distinction) is probably suited to becoming a desktop app. You could build a desktop app around any web app that would benefit from integration in the user’s system; think native notifications, launching on startup, interacting with files, etc. Some users simply prefer having certain apps there permanently on their machine, accessible whether they have a connection or not.</p>\n<p>Maybe you’ve an idea that would only work as a desktop app; some things simply aren’t possible with a web app (at least yet, but more about that in a little bit). You could create a self-contained utility app for internal company use, without requiring anyone to install anything other than your app (because Node.js in built-in). Maybe you’ve an idea for the Mac App Store. Maybe it would simply be a fun side project.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to sum up why you should consider creating a desktop app because there are so many kinds of apps you could create. It really depends on what you’d like to achieve, how advantageous you find the additional APIs, and how much offline usage would enhance the experience for your users. For my team, it was a no-brainer because we were building a <a href="https://teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">chat application</a>. On the other hand, a connection-dependent desktop app that doesn’t really have any desktop integration should be a web app and a web app alone. It wouldn’t be fair to expect a user to download your app (which includes a browser of its own and Node.js) when they wouldn’t get any more value from it than from visiting a URL of yours in their favorite browser.</p>\n<p>Instead of describing the desktop app you personally should build and why, I’m hoping to spark an idea or at least spark your interest in this article. Read on to see just how easy it is to create powerful desktop apps using web technology and what that can afford you over (or alongside of) creating a web app.</p>\n<h3><a id="nwjs" class="post-header-anchor" href="#nwjs" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>NW.js</h3>\n<p>Desktop applications have been around a long time but you don’t have all day, so let’s skip some history and begin in Shanghai, 2011. Roger Wang, of Intel’s Open Source Technology Center, created node-webkit; a proof-of-concept Node.js module that allowed the user to spawn a WebKit browser window and use Node.js modules within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>After some progress and a switch from WebKit to Chromium (the open-source project Google Chrome is based on), an intern named Cheng Zhao joined the project. It was soon realized that an app runtime based on Node.js and Chromium would make a nice framework for building desktop apps. The project went on be quite popular.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: node-webkit was later renamed NW.js to make it a bit more generic because it no longer used Node.js or WebKit. Instead of Node.js, it was based on io.js (the Node.js fork) at the time, and Chromium had moved on from WebKit to its own fork, Blink.</p>\n<p>So, if you were to download an NW.js app, you would actually be downloading Chromium, plus Node.js, plus the actual app code. Not only does this mean a desktop app can be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the app would also have access to all of the Node.js APIs (to read and write to disk, for example), and the end user wouldn’t know any better. That’s pretty powerful, but how does it work? Well, first let’s take a look at Chromium.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/chromiumDiagram.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/chromiumDiagram.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A rough diagram of Chromium\'s internals. (Note: this diagram is intentionally very simple; it\'s a lot more complex than this.)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>There is a main background process, and each tab gets its own process. You might have seen that Google Chrome always has at least two processes in Windows\' task manager or macOS\' activity monitor. I haven\'t even attempted to arrange the contents of the main process here, but it contains the Blink rendering engine, the V8 JavaScript engine (which is what Node.js is built on, too, by the way) and some platform APIs that abstract native APIs. Each isolated tab or renderer process has access to the JavaScript engine, CSS parser and so on, but it is completely separate to the main process for fault tolerance. Renderer processes interact with the main process through interprocess communication (IPC).</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsDiagram.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsDiagram.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A rough diagram of an NW.js app\'s internals.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>This is roughly what an NW.js app looks like. It’s basically the same, except that each window has access to Node.js now as well. So, you have access to the DOM and you can require other scripts, node modules you’ve installed from npm, or built-in modules provided by NW.js. By default, your app has one window, and from there you can spawn other windows.</p>\n<p>Creating an app is really easy. All you need is an HTML file and a <code>package.json</code>, like you would have when working with Node.js. You can create a default one by running <code>npm init --yes</code>. Typically, a <code>package.json</code> would point a JavaScript file as the “main” file for the module (i.e. using the <code>main</code> property), but with NW.js you need to edit the <code>main</code> property to point to your HTML file.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token string">"name"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"example-app"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"version"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"1.0.0"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"description"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"index.html"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"scripts"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token string">"test"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"keywords"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"author"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"license"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"ISC"</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class="language-markup"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --\x3e</span>\n<span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Example app<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class="token attr-name">name</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>viewport<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">content</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>width=device-width, initial-scale=1<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Hello, world!<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you install the official <code>nw</code> package from npm (by running <code>npm install -g nw</code>), you can run <code>nw .</code> within the project directory to launch your app.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsHelloWorld.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsHelloWorld.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of our example NW.js app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>It’s as easy as that.

In 2015, atom-shell was renamed Electron.

First of all, Electron is less browser-oriented than NW.js. The entry point for an Electron app is a script that runs in the main process.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/electronDiagram.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/electronDiagram.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A rough diagram of an Electron app\'s internals.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>The Electron team patched Chromium to allow for the embedding of multiple JavaScript engines that could run at the same time. So, when Chromium releases a new version, they don’t have to do anything.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: NW.js hooks into Chromium a little differently, and this was often blamed on the fact NW.js wasn’t quite as good at keeping up with Chromium as Electron was. However, throughout 2016, NW.js has released a new version within 24 hours of each major Chromium release, which the team attributes to an organizational shift.</p>\n<p>Back to the main process. Your app hasn’t any window by default, but you can open as many windows as you’d like from the main process, each having its own renderer process, just like NW.js.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, the minimum you need for an Electron app is a main JavaScript file (which we’ll leave empty for now) and a <code>package.json</code> that points to it. Then, all you need to do is <code>npm install --save-dev electron</code> and run <code>electron .</code> to launch your app.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token string">"name"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"example-app"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"version"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"1.0.0"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"description"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"main.js"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"scripts"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token string">"test"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"keywords"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"author"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"license"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"ISC"</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// main.js, which is empty</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not much will happen, though, because your app hasn’t any window by default.

For example, the main process is where, and only where, you can manage your windows, automatic updates and more. You might want a click of a button to trigger something in your main process, though, so Electron comes with built-in methods for IPC. You can basically emit arbitrary events and listen for them on the other side. In this case, you’d catch the <code>click</code> event in the renderer process, emit an event over IPC to the main process, catch it in the main process and finally perform the action.</p>\n<p>OK, so Electron has distinct processes, and you have to organize your app slightly differently, but that’s not a big deal. Why are people using Electron instead of NW.js? Well, there’s mindshare. So many related tools and modules are out there as a result of its popularity. The documentation is better. Most importantly, it has fewer bugs and superior APIs.</p>\n<p>Electron’s documentation really is amazing, though — that’s worth emphasizing. Take the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos" rel="noopener">Electron API Demos app</a>. It’s an Electron app that interactively demonstrates what you can do with Electron’s APIs. Not only is the API described and sample code provided for creating a new window, for example, but clicking a button will actually execute the code and a new window will open.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/apiDemosApp.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/apiDemosApp.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of the Electron API Demos app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>If you submit an issue via Electron’s bug tracker, you’ll get a response within a couple of days. I’ve seen three-year-old NW.js bugs, although I don’t hold it against them. It’s tough when an open-source project is written in languages drastically different from the languages known by its users. NW.js and Electron are written mostly in C++ (and a tiny bit of Objective C++) but used by people who write JavaScript. I’m extremely grateful for what NW.js has given us.</p>\n<p>Electron ironed out a few of the flaws in the NW.js APIs. For example, you can bind global keyboard shortcuts, which would be caught even if your app isn’t focused. An example API flaw I ran into was that binding to <code>Control + Shift + A</code> in an NW.js app did what you would expect on Windows, but actually bound to <code>Command + Shift + A</code> on a Mac. This was intentional but really weird. There was no way to bind to the <code>Control</code> key. Also, binding to the <code>Command</code> key did bind to the <code>Command</code> key but the <code>Windows</code> key on Windows and Linux as well. The Electron team spotted these problems (when adding shortcuts to Atom I assume) and quickly updated their globalShortcut API so both of these cases work as you’d expect. To be fair, NW.js has since fixed the former but not the latter.</p>\n<p>There are a few other differences. For instance, in recent NW.js versions, notifications that were previously native are now Chrome-style ones. These don’t go into the notification centre on Mac OS X or Windows 10, but there are modules on npm that you could use as a workaround if you’d like. If you want to do something interesting with audio or video, use Electron, because some codecs don’t work out of the box with NW.js.</p>\n<p>Electron has added a few new APIs as well, more desktop integration, and it has built-in support for automatic updates, but I’ll cover that later.</p>\n<h3><a id="but-how-does-it-feel" class="post-header-anchor" href="#but-how-does-it-feel" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>But How Does It Feel?</h3>\n<p>It feels fine. Sure, it’s not native. Most desktop apps these days don’t look like Windows Explorer or Finder anyway, so users won’t mind or realize that HTML is behind your user interface. You can make it feel more native if you’d like, but I’m not convinced it will make the experience any better. For example, you could prevent the cursor from turning to a hand when the user hovers over a button. That’s how a native desktop app would act, but is that better?

Is it slow or laggy? Well, your app is essentially a web app. It’ll perform pretty much like a web app in Google Chrome. You can create a performant app or a sluggish one, but that’s fine because you already have the skills to analyze and improve performance. One of the best things about your app being based on Chromium is that you get its DevTools. You can debug within the app or remotely, and the Electron team has even created a DevTools extension named <a href="http://electron.atom.io/devtron/" rel="noopener">Devtron</a> to monitor some Electron-specific stuff.</p>\n<p>Your desktop app can be more performant than a web app, though. One thing you could do is create a worker window, a hidden window that you use to perform any expensive work.

Electron, on the other hand, comes with Mac App Store-compatible builds, which are just like the normal builds except that you don’t have access to some modules, such as the auto-updater module (which is fine because your app will update via the Mac App Store anyway).</p>\n<p>Electron even supports ARM builds, so your app can run on a Chromebook or Raspberry Pi. Finally, Google may be <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html" rel="noopener">phasing out Chrome Packaged Apps</a>, but NW.js allows you to port an app over to an NW.js app and still have access the same Chromium APIs.</p>\n<p>Even though 32-bit and 64-bit builds are supported, you’ll get away with 64-bit Mac and Windows apps. You will need 32-bit and 64-bit Linux apps, though, for compatibility.</p>\n<p>So, let’s say that Electron has won over and you want to ship an Electron app. There’s a nice Node.js module named <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager" rel="noopener">electron-packager</a> that helps with packing your app up into an <code>.app</code> or <code>.exe</code> file. A few similar projects exist, including interactive ones that prompt you step by step. You should use <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder" rel="noopener">electron-builder</a>, though, which builds on top of electron-packager, plus a few other related modules. It generates <code>.dmg</code>s and Windows installers and takes care of the code-signing of your app for you. This is really important. Without it, your app would be labelled as untrusted by operating systems, your app could trigger anti-virus software, and Microsoft SmartScreen might try to block the user from launching your app.</p>\n<p>The annoying thing about code-signing is that you have to sign your app on a Mac for Mac and on Windows for Windows. So, if you’re serious about shipping desktop apps, then you’ll need to build on multiple machines for each release.</p>\n<p>This can feel a bit too manual or tedious, especially if you’re used to creating for the web. Thankfully, electron-builder was created with automation in mind. I’m talking here about continuous integration tools and services such as <a href="https://jenkins.io/" rel="noopener">Jenkins</a>, <a href="http://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" rel="noopener">Travis-CI</a>, <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/" rel="noopener">AppVeyor</a> (for Windows) and so on. These could run your desktop app build at the press of a button or at every push to GitHub, for example.</p>\n<h3><a id="automatic-updates" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automatic-updates" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automatic Updates</h3>\n<p>NW.js doesn’t have automatic update support, but you’ll have access to all of Node.js, so you can do whatever you want. Open-source modules are out there for it, such as <a href="https://github.com/edjafarov/node-webkit-updater" rel="noopener">node-webkit-updater</a>, which handles downloading and replacing your app with a newer version. You could also roll your own custom system if you wanted.</p>\n<p>Electron has built-in support for automatic updates, via its <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/auto-updater/" rel="noopener">autoUpdater</a> API. It doesn’t support Linux, first of all; instead, publishing your app to Linux package managers is recommended. This is common on Linux — don’t worry. The <code>autoUpdater</code> API is really simple; once you give it a URL, you can call the <code>checkForUpdates</code> method. It’s event-driven, so you can subscribe to the <code>update-downloaded</code> event, for example, and once it’s fired, call the <code>restartAndInstall</code> method to install the new version and restart the app. You can listen for a few other events, which you can use to tie the auto-updating functionality into your user interface nicely.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You can have multiple update channels if you want, such as Google Chrome and Google Chrome Canary.</p>\n<p>It’s not quite as simple behind the API. It’s based on the Squirrel update framework, which differs drastically between Mac and Windows, which use the <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac" rel="noopener">Squirrel.Mac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows" rel="noopener">Squirrel.Windows</a> projects, respectively.</p>\n<p>The update code within your Mac Electron app is simple, but you’ll need a server (albeit a simple server). When you call the autoUpdater module’s <code>checkForUpdates</code> method, it will hit your server. What your server needs to do is return a 204 (“No Content”) if there isn’t an update; and if there is, it needs to return a 200 with a JSON containing a URL pointing to a <code>.zip</code> file. Back under the hood of your app (or the client), Squirrel.Mac will know what to do. It’ll go get that <code>.zip</code>, unzip it and fire the appropriate events.</p>\n<p>There a bit more (magic) going on in your Windows app when it comes to automatic updates. You won’t need a server, but you can have one if you’d like. You could host the static (update) files somewhere, such as AWS S3, or even have them locally on your machine, which is really handy for testing. Despite the differences between Squirrel.Mac and Squirrel.Windows, a happy medium can be found; for example, having a server for both, and storing the updates on S3 or somewhere similar.</p>\n<p>Squirrel.Windows has a couple of nice features over Squirrel.Mac as well. It applies updates in the background; so, when you call <code>restartAndInstall</code>, it’ll be a bit quicker because it’s ready and waiting. It also supports delta updates. Let’s say your app checks for updates and there is one newer version. A binary diff (between the currently installed app and the update) will be downloaded and applied as a patch to the current executable, instead of replacing it with a whole new app. It can even do that incrementally if you’re, say, three versions behind, but it will only do that if it’s worth it. Otherwise, if you’re, say, 15 versions behind, it will just download the latest version in its entirety instead. The great thing is that all of this is done under the hood for you. The API remains really simple. You check for updates, it will figure out the optimal method to apply the update, and it will let you know when it’s ready to go.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You will have to generate those binary diffs, though, and host them alongside your standard updates. Thankfully, electron-builder generates these for you, too.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Electron community, you don’t have to build your own server if you don’t want to. There are open-source projects you can use. Some allow you to <a href="https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server" rel="noopener">store updates on S3</a> or use <a href="https://github.com/GitbookIO/nuts" rel="noopener">GitHub releases</a>, and some even go as far as <a href="https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server" rel="noopener">providing administrative dashboards</a> to manage the updates.</p>\n<h3><a id="desktop-versus-web" class="post-header-anchor" href="#desktop-versus-web" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Desktop Versus Web</h3>\n<p>So, how does making a desktop app differ from making a web app? Let’s look at a few unexpected problems or gains you might come across along the way, some unexpected side effects of APIs you’re used to using on the web, workflow pain points, maintenance woes and more.</p>\n<p>Well, the first thing that comes to mind is browser lock-in. It’s like a guilty pleasure. If you’re making a desktop app exclusively, you’ll know exactly which Chromium version all of your users are on. Let your imagination run wild; you can use flexbox, ES6, pure WebSockets, WebRTC, anything you want. You can even enable experimental features in Chromium for your app (i.e. features coming down the line) or tweak settings such as your localStorage allowance. You’ll never have to deal with any cross-browser incompatibilities. This is on top of Node.js’ APIs and all of npm. You can do anything.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You’ll still have to consider which operating system the user is running sometimes, though, but OS-sniffing is a lot more reliable and less frowned upon than browser sniffing.</p>\n<h4><a id="working-with-file" class="post-header-anchor" href="#working-with-file" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Working With file://</h4>\n<p>Another interesting thing is that your app is essentially offline-first. Keep that in mind when creating your app; a user can launch your app without a network connection and your app will run; it will still load the local files. You’ll need to pay more attention to how your app behaves if the network connection is lost while it’s running. You may need to adjust your mindset.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You can load remote URLs if you really want, but I wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>One tip I can give you here is not to trust <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine" rel="noopener"><code>navigator.onLine</code></a> completely. This property returns a Boolean indicating whether or not there’s a connection, but watch out for false positives. It’ll return <code>true</code> if there’s any local connection without validating that connection. The Internet might not actually be accessible; it could be fooled by a dummy connection to a Vagrant virtual machine on your machine, etc. Instead, use Sindre Sorhus’ <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-online" rel="noopener"><code>is-online</code></a> module to double-check; it will ping the Internet’s root servers and/or the favicon of a few popular websites. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> isOnline <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'is-online\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>navigator<span class="token punctuation">.</span>onLine<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token comment">// hmm there\'s a connection, but is the Internet accessible?</span>\n  <span class="token function">isOnline</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>online <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>online<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// true or false</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n<span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token comment">// we can trust navigator.onLine when it says there is no connection</span>\n  console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Speaking of local files, there are a few things to be aware of when using the <code>file://</code> protocol — protocol-less URLs, for one; you can’t use them anymore. I mean URLs that start with <code>//</code> instead of <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. Typically, if a web app requests <code>//example.com/hello.json</code>, then your browser would expand this to <code>http://example.com/hello.json</code> or to <code>https://example.com/hello.json</code> if the current page is loaded over HTTPS. In our app, the current page would load using the <code>file://</code> protocol; so, if we requested the same URL, it would expand to <code>file://example.com/hello.json</code> and fail. The real worry here is third-party modules you might be using; authors aren’t thinking of desktop apps when they make a library.</p>\n<p>You’d never use a CDN. Loading local files is basically instantaneous. There’s also no limit on the number of concurrent requests (per domain), like there is on the web (with HTTP/1.1 at least). You can load as many as you want in parallel.</p>\n<h4><a id="artifacts-galore" class="post-header-anchor" href="#artifacts-galore" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Artifacts Galore</h4>\n<p>A lot of asset generation is involved in creating a solid desktop app. You’ll need to generate executables and installers and decide on an auto-update system. Then, for each update, you’ll have to build the executables again, more installers (because if someone goes to your website to download it, they should get the latest version) and binary diffs for delta updates.</p>\n<p>Weight is still a concern. A “Hello, World!” Electron app is 40 MB zipped. Besides the typical advice you follow when creating a web app (write less code, minify it, have fewer dependencies, etc.), there isn’t much I can offer you. The “Hello, World!” app is literally an app containing one HTML file; most of the weight comes from the fact that Chromium and Node.js are baked into your app. At least delta updates will reduce how much is downloaded when a user performs an update (on Windows only, I’m afraid). However, your users won’t be downloading your app on a 2G connection (hopefully!).</p>\n<h4><a id="expect-the-unexpected" class="post-header-anchor" href="#expect-the-unexpected" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Expect the Unexpected</h4>\n<p>You will discover unexpected behavior now and again. Some of it is more obvious than the rest, but a little annoying nonetheless. For example, let’s say you’ve made a music player app that supports a mini-player mode, in which the window is really small and always in front of any other apps. If a user were to click or tap a dropdown (<code>&lt;select/&gt;</code>), then it would open to reveal its options, overflowing past the bottom edge of the app. If you were to use a non-native select library (such as select2 or chosen), though, you’re in trouble. When open, your dropdown will be cut off by the edge of your app. So, the user would see a few items and then nothing, which is really frustrating. This would happen in a web browser, too, but it’s not often the user would resize the window down to a small enough size.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/dropdownComparison.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/dropdownComparison.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Screenshots comparing what happens to a native dropdown versus a non-native one as they hit any edges of an app window.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>You may or may not know it, but on a Mac, every window has a header and a body. When a window isn’t focused, if you hover over an icon or button in the header, its appearance will reflect the fact that it’s being hovered over. For example, the close button on macOS is gray when the window is blurred but red when you hover over it. However, if you move your mouse over something in the body of the window, there is no visible change. This is intentional. Think about your desktop app, though; it’s Chromium missing the header, and your app is the web page, which is the body of the window. You could drop the native frame and create your own custom HTML buttons instead for minimize, maximize and close. If your window isn’t focused, though, they won’t react if you were to hover over them. Hover styles won’t be applied, and that feels really wrong. To make it worse, if you were to click the close button, for example, it would focus the window and that’s it. A second click would be required to actually click the button and close the app.</p>\n<p>To add insult to injury, Chromium has a bug that can mask the problem, making you think it works as you might have originally expected. If you move your mouse fast enough (nothing too unreasonable) from outside the window to an element inside the window, hover styles will be applied to that element. It’s a confirmed bug; applying the hover styles on a blurred window body “doesn’t meet platform expectations,” so it will be fixed. Hopefully, I’m saving you some heartbreak here. You could have a situation in which you’ve created beautiful custom window controls, yet in reality a lot of your users will be frustrated with your app (and will guess it’s not native).</p>\n<p>So, you must use native buttons on a Mac. There’s no way around that. For an NW.js app, you must enable the native frame, which is the default anyway (you can disable it by setting <code>window</code> object’s <code>frame</code> property to <code>false</code> in your <code>package.json</code>).</p>\n<p>You could do the same with an Electron app. This is controlled by setting the <code>frame</code> property when creating a window; for example, <code>new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, frame: true})</code>. As the Electron team does, they spotted this issue and added another option as a nice compromise; <code>titleBarStyle</code>. Setting this to <code>hidden</code> will hide the native title bar but keep the native window controls overlaid over the top-left corner of your app. This gets you around the problem of having non-native buttons on Mac, but you can still style the top of the app (and the area behind the buttons) however you like.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// main.js</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>app<span class="token punctuation">,</span> BrowserWindow<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'electron\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">let</span> mainWindow<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\napp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">on</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'ready\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  mainWindow <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">BrowserWindow</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    width<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">500</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    height<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">400</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    titleBarStyle<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'hidden\'</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  mainWindow<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">loadURL</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'file://\'</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> __dirname <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\'/index.html\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here’s an app in which I’ve disabled the title bar and given the <code>html</code> element a background image:</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/hiddenTitleBar.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/hiddenTitleBar.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of our example app without the title bar.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>See “<a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/frameless-window" rel="noopener">Frameless Window</a>” from Electron’s documentation for more.</p>\n<h4><a id="tooling" class="post-header-anchor" href="#tooling" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Tooling</h4>\n<p>Well, you can pretty much use all of the tooling you’d use to create a web app. Your app is just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, right? Plenty of plugins and modules are out there specifically for desktop apps, too, such as Gulp plugins for signing your app, for example (if you didn’t want to use electron-builder). <a href="https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect" rel="noopener">Electron-connect</a> watches your files for changes, and when they occur, it’ll inject those changes into your open window(s) or relaunch the app if it was your main script that was modified. It is Node.js, after all; you can pretty much do anything you’d like. You could run webpack inside your app if you wanted to — I’ve no idea why you would, but the options are endless.

First of all, the release flow is completely different. A significant mindset adjustment is required. When you’re working on the web app and you deploy a change that breaks something, it’s not really a huge deal (of course, that depends on your app and the bug). You can just roll out a fix. Users who reload or change the page and new users who trickle in will get the latest code. Developers under pressure might rush out a feature for a deadline and fix bugs as they’re reported or noticed. You can’t do that with desktop apps. You can’t take back updates you push out there. It’s more like a mobile app flow. You build the app, put it out there, and you can’t take it back. Some users might not even update from a buggy version to the fixed version. This will make you worry about all of the bugs out there in old versions.</p>\n<h4><a id="quantum-mechanics" class="post-header-anchor" href="#quantum-mechanics" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Quantum Mechanics</h4>\n<p>Because a host of different versions of your app are in use, your code will exist in multiple forms and states. Multiple variants of your client (desktop app) could be hitting your API in 10 slightly different ways. So, you’ll need to strongly consider versioning your API, really locking down and testing it well. When an API change is to be introduced, you might not be sure if it’s a breaking change or not. A version released a month ago could implode because it has some slightly different code.</p>\n<h4><a id="fresh-problems-to-solve" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fresh-problems-to-solve" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fresh Problems to Solve</h4>\n<p>You might receive a few strange bug reports — ones that involve bizarre user account arrangements, specific antivirus software or worse. I had a case in which a user had installed something (or had done something themselves) that messed with their system’s environment variables. This broke our app because a dependency we used for something critical failed to execute a system command because the command could no longer be found. This is a good example because there will be occasions when you’ll have to draw a line. This was something critical to our app, so we couldn’t ignore the error, and we couldn’t fix their machine. For users like this, a lot of their desktop apps would be somewhat broken at best. In the end, we decided to show a tailored error screen to the user if this unlikely error were ever to pop up again. It links to a document explaining why it has occurred and has a step-by-step guide to fix it.</p>\n<p>Sure, a few web-specific concerns are no longer applicable when you’re working on a desktop app, such as legacy browsers. You will have a few new ones to take into consideration, though. There’s a 256-character limit on file paths in Windows, for example.</p>\n<p>Old versions of npm store dependencies in a recursive file structure. Your dependencies would each get stored in their own directory within a <code>node_modules</code> directory in your project (for example, <code>node_modules/a</code>). If any of your dependencies have dependencies of their own, those grandchild dependencies would be stored in a <code>node_modules</code> within that directory (for example, <code>node_modules/a/node_modules/b</code>). Because Node.js and npm encourage small single-purpose modules, you could easily end up with a really long path, like <code>path/to/your/project/node_modules/a/node_modules/b/node_modules/c/.../n/index.js</code>.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: Since version 3, npm flattens out the dependency tree as much as possible. However, there are other causes for long paths.</p>\n<p>We had a case in which our app wouldn’t launch at all (or would crash soon after launching) on certain versions of Windows due to an exceeding long path. This was a major headache. With Electron, you can put all of your app’s code into an <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/application-packaging/" rel="noopener">asar archive</a>, which protects against path length issues but has exceptions and can’t always be used.</p>\n<p>We created a little Gulp plugin named <a href="https://github.com/Teamwork/gulp-path-length" rel="noopener">gulp-path-length</a>, which lets you know whether any dangerously long file paths are in your app. Where your app is stored on the end user’s machine will determine the true length of the path, though. In our case, our installer will install it to <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming</code>. So, when our app is built (locally by us or by a continuous integration service), gulp-path-length is instructed to audit our files as if they’re stored there (on the user’s machine with a long username, to be safe).</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">var</span> gulp <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'gulp\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">var</span> pathLength <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'gulp-path-length\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\ngulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">task</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'default\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">src</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'./example/**/*\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>read<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n        <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">pipe</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">pathLength</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t        rewrite<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t\t        match<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'./example\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n\t\t        replacement<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'C:\\\\Users\\\\this-is-a-long-username\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Teamwork Chat\\\\\'</span>\n\t        <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n        <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a id="fatal-errors-can-be-really-fatal" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fatal-errors-can-be-really-fatal" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fatal Errors Can Be Really Fatal</h4>\n<p>Because all of the automatic updates handling is done within the app, you could have an uncaught exception that crashes the app before it even gets to check for an update.

First of all, Google Analytics won’t work (out of the box, at least). You’ll have to find something that doesn’t mind an app that runs on <code>file://</code> URLs. If you’re using a tool to track errors, make sure to lock down errors by app version if the tool supports release-tracking. For example, if you’re using <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/" rel="noopener">Sentry</a> to track errors, make sure to <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/clients/javascript/config/#optional-settings" rel="noopener">set the <code>release</code> property when setting up your client</a>, so that errors will be split up by app version. Otherwise, if you receive a report about an error and roll out a fix, you’ll keep on receiving reports about the error, filling up your reports or logs with false positives. These errors will be coming from people using older versions.</p>\n<p>Electron has a <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/crash-reporter/" rel="noopener"><code>crashReporter</code></a> module, which will send you a report any time the app completely crashes (i.e. the entire app dies, not for any old error thrown).

Also, never accept user input and pass it to a native API or command without proper sanitation.</p>\n<p>Don’t trust code from vendors either. We had a problem recently with a third-party snippet we had included in our app for analytics, provided by company X. The team behind it rolled out an update with some dodgy code, thereby introducing a fatal error in our app. When a user launched our app, the snippet grabbed the newest JavaScript from their CDN and ran it. The error thrown prevented anything further from executing. Anyone with the app already running was unaffected, but if they were to quit it and launch it again, they’d have the problem, too. We contacted X’s support team and they promptly rolled out a fix. Our app was fine again once our users restarted it, but it was scary there for a while. We wouldn’t have been able to patch the problem ourselves without forcing affected users to manually download a new version of the app (with the snippet removed).</p>\n<p>How can you mitigate this risk? You could try to catch errors, but you’ve no idea what they company X might do in its JavaScript, so you’re better off with something more solid. You could add a level of abstraction. Instead of pointing directly to X’s URL from your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, you could use <a href="https://www.google.ie/analytics/tag-manager/" rel="noopener">Google Tag Manager</a> or your own API to return either HTML containing the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags or a single JavaScript file containing all of your third-party dependencies somehow. This would enable you to change which snippets get loaded (by tweaking Google Tag Manager or your API endpoint) without having to roll out a new update.</p>\n<p>However, if the API no longer returned the analytics snippet, the global variable created by the snippet would still be there in your code, trying to call undefined functions. So, we haven’t solved the problem entirely. Also, this API call would fail if a user launches the app without a connection. You don’t want to restrict your app when offline. Sure, you could use a cached result from the last time the request succeeded, but what if there was a bug in that version? You’re back to the same problem.</p>\n<p>Another solution would be to create a hidden window and load a (local) HTML file there that contains all of your third-party snippets. So, any global variables that the snippets create would be scoped to that window. Any errors thrown would be thrown in that window and your main window(s) would be unaffected. If you needed to use those APIs or global variables in your main window(s), you’d do this via IPC now. You’d send an event over IPC to your main process, which would then send it onto the hidden window, and if it was still healthy, it would listen for the event and call the third-party function. That would work.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to security. What if someone malicious at company X were to include some dangerous Node.js code in their JavaScript? We’d be rightly screwed. Luckily, Electron has a nice option to disable Node.js for a given window, so it simply wouldn’t run:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// main.js</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>app<span class="token punctuation">,</span> BrowserWindow<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'electron\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">let</span> thirdPartyWindow<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\napp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">on</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'ready\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  thirdPartyWindow <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">BrowserWindow</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    width<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">500</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    height<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">400</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    webPreferences<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n      nodeIntegration<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  thirdPartyWindow<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">loadURL</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'file://\'</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> __dirname <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\'/third-party-snippets.html\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a id="automated-testing" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automated-testing" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automated Testing</h4>\n<p>NW.js doesn’t have any built-in support for testing. But, again, you have access to Node.js, so it’s technically possible. There is a way to test stuff such as button-clicking within the app using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface" rel="noopener">Chrome Remote Interface</a>, but it’s tricky. Even then, you can’t trigger a click on a native window control and test what happens, for example.</p>\n<p>The Electron team has created <a href="http://electron.atom.io/spectron/" rel="noopener">Spectron</a> for automated testing, and it supports testing native controls, managing windows and simulating Electron events. It can even be run in continuous integration builds.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">var</span> Application <span class="token operator">=</span> <span

As a web developer, you have all of the tools required to make an app for either environment. Why not both? It takes a bit more effort, but it’s worth it. I’ll mention a few related topics and tools, which are complicated in their own right, so I’ll keep just touch on them.</p>\n<p>First of all, forget about “browser lock-in,” native WebSockets, etc. The same goes for ES6. You can either revert to writing plain old ES5 JavaScript or use something like <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="noopener">Babel</a> to transpile your ES6 into ES5, for web use.</p>\n<p>You also have <code>require</code>s throughout your code (for importing other scripts or modules), which a browser won’t understand. Use a module bundler that supports CommonJS (i.e. Node.js-style <code>require</code>s), such as <a href="http://rollupjs.org" rel="noopener">Rollup</a>, <a href="https://webpack.github.io" rel="noopener">webpack</a> or <a href="http://browserify.org" rel="noopener">Browserify</a>. When making a build for the web, a module bundler will run over your code, traverse all of the <code>require</code>s and bundle them up into one script for you.</p>\n<p>Any code using Node.js or Electron APIs (i.e. to write to disk or integrate with the desktop environment) should not be called when the app is running on the web. You can detect this by checking whether <code>process.version.nwjs</code> or <code>process.versions.electron</code> exists; if it does, then your app is currently running in the desktop environment.</p>\n<p>Even then, you’ll be loading a lot of redundant code in the web app. Let’s say you have a <code>require</code> guarded behind a check like <code>if(app.isInDesktop)</code>, along with a big chunk of desktop-specific code. Instead of detecting the environment at runtime and setting <code>app.isInDesktop</code>, you could pass <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> into your app as a flag at buildtime (for example, using the <a href="https://github.com/hughsk/envify" rel="noopener">envify</a> transform for Browserify). This will aide your module bundler of choice when it’s doing its static analysis and tree-shaking (i.e. dead-code elimination). It will now know whether <code>app.isInDesktop</code> is <code>true</code>. So, if you’re running your web build, it won’t bother going inside that <code>if</code> statement or traversing the <code>require</code> in question.</p>\n<h4><a id="continuous-delivery" class="post-header-anchor" href="#continuous-delivery" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Continuous Delivery</h4>\n<p>There’s that release mindset again; it’s challenging. When you’re working on the web, you want to be able to roll out changes frequently. I believe in continually delivering small incremental changes that can be rolled back quickly. Ideally, with enough testing, an intern can push a little tweak to your master branch, resulting in your web app being automatically tested and deployed.</p>\n<p>As we covered earlier, you can’t really do this with a desktop app. OK, I guess you technically could if you’re using Electron, because electron-builder can be automated and, so, can spectron tests. I don’t know anyone doing this, and I wouldn’t have enough faith to do it myself. Remember, broken code can’t be taken back, and you could break the update flow. Besides, you don’t want to deliver desktop updates too often anyway. Updates aren’t silent, like they are on the web, so it’s not very nice for the user. Plus, for users on macOS, delta updates aren’t supported, so users would be downloading a full new app for each release, no matter how small a tweak it has.</p>\n<p>You’ll have to find a balance. A happy medium might be to release all fixes to the web as soon as possible and release a desktop app weekly or monthly — unless you’re releasing a feature, that is. You don’t want to punish a user because they chose to install your desktop app. Nothing’s worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realize that you’ll have to wait a while longer than everyone else. You could employ a feature-flags API to roll out features on both platforms at the same time, but that’s a whole separate topic. I first learned of feature flags from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">Continuous Delivery: The Dirty Details</a>,” a talk by Etsy’s VP of Engineering, Mike Brittain.</p>\n<h3><a id="conclusion" class="post-header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>So, there you have it.

Any existing web app (as opposed to a website, if you believe in the distinction) is probably suited to becoming a desktop app. You could build a desktop app around any web app that would benefit from integration in the user’s system; think native notifications, launching on startup, interacting with files, etc. Some users simply prefer having certain apps there permanently on their machine, accessible whether they have a connection or not.</p>\n<p>Maybe you’ve an idea that would only work as a desktop app; some things simply aren’t possible with a web app (at least yet, but more about that in a little bit). You could create a self-contained utility app for internal company use, without requiring anyone to install anything other than your app (because Node.js in built-in). Maybe you’ve an idea for the Mac App Store. Maybe it would simply be a fun side project.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to sum up why you should consider creating a desktop app because there are so many kinds of apps you could create. It really depends on what you’d like to achieve, how advantageous you find the additional APIs, and how much offline usage would enhance the experience for your users. For my team, it was a no-brainer because we were building a <a href="https://teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">chat application</a>. On the other hand, a connection-dependent desktop app that doesn’t really have any desktop integration should be a web app and a web app alone. It wouldn’t be fair to expect a user to download your app (which includes a browser of its own and Node.js) when they wouldn’t get any more value from it than from visiting a URL of yours in their favorite browser.</p>\n<p>Instead of describing the desktop app you personally should build and why, I’m hoping to spark an idea or at least spark your interest in this article. Read on to see just how easy it is to create powerful desktop apps using web technology and what that can afford you over (or alongside of) creating a web app.</p>\n<h3><a id="nwjs" class="post-header-anchor" href="#nwjs" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>NW.js</h3>\n<p>Desktop applications have been around a long time but you don’t have all day, so let’s skip some history and begin in Shanghai, 2011. Roger Wang, of Intel’s Open Source Technology Center, created node-webkit; a proof-of-concept Node.js module that allowed the user to spawn a WebKit browser window and use Node.js modules within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>After some progress and a switch from WebKit to Chromium (the open-source project Google Chrome is based on), an intern named Cheng Zhao joined the project. It was soon realized that an app runtime based on Node.js and Chromium would make a nice framework for building desktop apps. The project went on be quite popular.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: node-webkit was later renamed NW.js to make it a bit more generic because it no longer used Node.js or WebKit. Instead of Node.js, it was based on io.js (the Node.js fork) at the time, and Chromium had moved on from WebKit to its own fork, Blink.</p>\n<p>So, if you were to download an NW.js app, you would actually be downloading Chromium, plus Node.js, plus the actual app code. Not only does this mean a desktop app can be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the app would also have access to all of the Node.js APIs (to read and write to disk, for example), and the end user wouldn’t know any better. That’s pretty powerful, but how does it work? Well, first let’s take a look at Chromium.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/chromiumDiagram.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/chromiumDiagram.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A rough diagram of Chromium\'s internals. (Note: this diagram is intentionally very simple; it\'s a lot more complex than this.)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>There is a main background process, and each tab gets its own process. You might have seen that Google Chrome always has at least two processes in Windows\' task manager or macOS\' activity monitor. I haven\'t even attempted to arrange the contents of the main process here, but it contains the Blink rendering engine, the V8 JavaScript engine (which is what Node.js is built on, too, by the way) and some platform APIs that abstract native APIs. Each isolated tab or renderer process has access to the JavaScript engine, CSS parser and so on, but it is completely separate to the main process for fault tolerance. Renderer processes interact with the main process through interprocess communication (IPC).</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsDiagram.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsDiagram.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A rough diagram of an NW.js app\'s internals.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>This is roughly what an NW.js app looks like. It’s basically the same, except that each window has access to Node.js now as well. So, you have access to the DOM and you can require other scripts, node modules you’ve installed from npm, or built-in modules provided by NW.js. By default, your app has one window, and from there you can spawn other windows.</p>\n<p>Creating an app is really easy. All you need is an HTML file and a <code>package.json</code>, like you would have when working with Node.js. You can create a default one by running <code>npm init --yes</code>. Typically, a <code>package.json</code> would point a JavaScript file as the “main” file for the module (i.e. using the <code>main</code> property), but with NW.js you need to edit the <code>main</code> property to point to your HTML file.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token string">"name"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"example-app"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"version"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"1.0.0"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"description"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"index.html"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"scripts"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token string">"test"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"keywords"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"author"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"license"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"ISC"</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class="language-markup"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --\x3e</span>\n<span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Example app<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class="token attr-name">name</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>viewport<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">content</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>width=device-width, initial-scale=1<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Hello, world!<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you install the official <code>nw</code> package from npm (by running <code>npm install -g nw</code>), you can run <code>nw .</code> within the project directory to launch your app.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsHelloWorld.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/nwjsHelloWorld.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of our example NW.js app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>It’s as easy as that. So, what happened here was that NW.js opened the initial window, loading your HTML file. I know this doesn’t look like much, but it’s up to you add some markup and styles, just like you would in a web app.</p>\n<p>You could drop the window bar and chrome if you like, or create your own custom frame. You could have semi to fully transparent windows, hidden windows and more. I took this a bit further recently and <a href="http://adamlynch.com/resurrecting-clippy/" rel="noopener">resurrected Clippy</a> using NW.js. There’s something weirdly satisfying about seeing Clippy on macOS or Windows 10.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/clippy.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/clippy.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of clippy.desktop on macOS.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>So, you get to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can use Node.js to read and write to disk, execute system commands, spawn other executables and more. Hypothetically, you could build a multiplayer roulette game over WebRTC that deletes some of the users\' files randomly, if you wanted.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/moduleCounts.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/moduleCounts.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Bar graph showing the number of modules per major package manager. (Source: <a href="http://modulecounts.com" rel="noopener">Module Counts</a>)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>You get access not only to Node.js’ APIs but to all of npm, which has over 350,000 modules now. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch" rel="noopener">auto-launch</a> is an open-source module we created at <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/" rel="noopener">Teamwork.com</a> to launch an NW.js or Electron app on startup.</p>\n<p>Node.js also has what’s known as “native modules,” which, if you really need to do something a bit lower level, allows you to create modules in C or C++.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, NW.js exposes APIs that effectively wrap native APIs, allowing you to integrate closely with the desktop environment. You can have a tray icon, open a file or URL in the default system application, and a lot lot more. All you need to do to trigger a notification is use the HTML5 notification API:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Notification</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'Hello\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  body<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'world\'</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a id="electron" class="post-header-anchor" href="#electron" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Electron</h3>\n<p>You might recognize GitHub’s text editor, Atom, below. Whether you use it or not, Atom was a game-changer for desktop apps. GitHub started development of Atom in 2013, soon recruited Cheng Zhao, and forked node-webkit as its base, which it later open-sourced under the name atom-shell.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/atom.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/atom.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of Atom, GitHub\'s text editor.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p><em>Note</em>: It’s disputed whether Electron is a fork of node-webkit or whether everything was rewritten from scratch. Either way, it’s effectively a fork for the end user because the APIs were almost identical.</p>\n<p>In making Atom, GitHub improved on the formula and ironed out a lot of the bugs. In 2015, atom-shell was renamed Electron. Since then it has hit version 1.0, and with GitHub pushing it, it has really taken off.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/logos.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/logos.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Logos of projects that use Electron.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>As well as Atom, other notable projects built with Electron include Slack, Visual Studio Code, Brave, HyperTerm and Nylas, which is really doing some cutting-edge stuff with it. Mozilla Tofino is an interesting one, too. It was an internal project at Mozilla (the company behind Firefox), with the aim of radically improving web browsers. Yeah, a team within Mozilla chose Electron (which is based on Chromium) for this experiment.</p>\n<h3><a id="how-does-it-differ" class="post-header-anchor" href="#how-does-it-differ" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>How Does It Differ?</h3>\n<p>But how is it different from NW.js? First of all, Electron is less browser-oriented than NW.js. The entry point for an Electron app is a script that runs in the main process.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/electronDiagram.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/electronDiagram.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A rough diagram of an Electron app\'s internals.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>The Electron team patched Chromium to allow for the embedding of multiple JavaScript engines that could run at the same time. So, when Chromium releases a new version, they don’t have to do anything.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: NW.js hooks into Chromium a little differently, and this was often blamed on the fact NW.js wasn’t quite as good at keeping up with Chromium as Electron was.

For example, the main process is where, and only where, you can manage your windows, automatic updates and more. You might want a click of a button to trigger something in your main process, though, so Electron comes with built-in methods for IPC. You can basically emit arbitrary events and listen for them on the other side. In this case, you’d catch the <code>click</code> event in the renderer process, emit an event over IPC to the main process, catch it in the main process and finally perform the action.</p>\n<p>OK, so Electron has distinct processes, and you have to organize your app slightly differently, but that’s not a big deal. Why are people using Electron instead of NW.js? Well, there’s mindshare. So many related tools and modules are out there as a result of its popularity. The documentation is better. Most importantly, it has fewer bugs and superior APIs.</p>\n<p>Electron’s documentation really is amazing, though — that’s worth emphasizing. Take the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos" rel="noopener">Electron API Demos app</a>. It’s an Electron app that interactively demonstrates what you can do with Electron’s APIs. Not only is the API described and sample code provided for creating a new window, for example, but clicking a button will actually execute the code and a new window will open.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/apiDemosApp.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/apiDemosApp.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of the Electron API Demos app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>If you submit an issue via Electron’s bug tracker, you’ll get a response within a couple of days. I’ve seen three-year-old NW.js bugs, although I don’t hold it against them. It’s tough when an open-source project is written in languages drastically different from the languages known by its users. NW.js and Electron are written mostly in C++ (and a tiny bit of Objective C++) but used by people who write JavaScript. I’m extremely grateful for what NW.js has given us.</p>\n<p>Electron ironed out a few of the flaws in the NW.js APIs. For example, you can bind global keyboard shortcuts, which would be caught even if your app isn’t focused. An example API flaw I ran into was that binding to <code>Control + Shift + A</code> in an NW.js app did what you would expect on Windows, but actually bound to <code>Command + Shift + A</code> on a Mac. This was intentional but really weird. There was no way to bind to the <code>Control</code> key. Also, binding to the <code>Command</code> key did bind to the <code>Command</code> key but the <code>Windows</code> key on Windows and Linux as well. The Electron team spotted these problems (when adding shortcuts to Atom I assume) and quickly updated their globalShortcut API so both of these cases work as you’d expect. To be fair, NW.js has since fixed the former but not the latter.</p>\n<p>There are a few other differences. For instance, in recent NW.js versions, notifications that were previously native are now Chrome-style ones. These don’t go into the notification centre on Mac OS X or Windows 10, but there are modules on npm that you could use as a workaround if you’d like. If you want to do something interesting with audio or video, use Electron, because some codecs don’t work out of the box with NW.js.</p>\n<p>Electron has added a few new APIs as well, more desktop integration, and it has built-in support for automatic updates, but I’ll cover that later.</p>\n<h3><a id="but-how-does-it-feel" class="post-header-anchor" href="#but-how-does-it-feel" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>But How Does It Feel?</h3>\n<p>It feels fine. Sure, it’s not native. Most desktop apps these days don’t look like Windows Explorer or Finder anyway, so users won’t mind or realize that HTML is behind your user interface. You can make it feel more native if you’d like, but I’m not convinced it will make the experience any better. For example, you could prevent the cursor from turning to a hand when the user hovers over a button. That’s how a native desktop app would act, but is that better? There are also projects out there like <a href="http://photonkit.com/" rel="noopener">Photon Kit</a>, which is basically a CSS framework like Bootstrap, but for macOS-style components.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/photon.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/photon.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of an example Electron app made with Photon.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><h3><a id="performance" class="post-header-anchor" href="#performance" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Performance</h3>\n<p>What about performance? Is it slow or laggy? Well, your app is essentially a web app. It’ll perform pretty much like a web app in Google Chrome. You can create a performant app or a sluggish one, but that’s fine because you already have the skills to analyze and improve performance. One of the best things about your app being based on Chromium is that you get its DevTools. You can debug within the app or remotely, and the Electron team has even created a DevTools extension named <a href="http://electron.atom.io/devtron/" rel="noopener">Devtron</a> to monitor some Electron-specific stuff.</p>\n<p>Your desktop app can be more performant than a web app, though. One thing you could do is create a worker window, a hidden window that you use to perform any expensive work. Because it’s an isolated process, any computation or processing going on in that window won’t affect rendering, scrolling or anything else in your visible window(s).</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you can always spawn system commands, spawn executables or drop down to native code if you really need to (you won’t).</p>\n<h3><a id="distribution" class="post-header-anchor" href="#distribution" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Distribution</h3>\n<p>Both NW.js and Electron support a wide array of platforms, including Windows, Mac and Linux. Electron doesn’t support Windows XP or Vista; NW.js does. Getting an NW.js app into the Mac App Store is a bit tricky; you’ll have to jump through a few hoops. Electron, on the other hand, comes with Mac App Store-compatible builds, which are just like the normal builds except that you don’t have access to some modules, such as the auto-updater module (which is fine because your app will update via the Mac App Store anyway).</p>\n<p>Electron even supports ARM builds, so your app can run on a Chromebook or Raspberry Pi. Finally, Google may be <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html" rel="noopener">phasing out Chrome Packaged Apps</a>, but NW.js allows you to port an app over to an NW.js app and still have access the same Chromium APIs.</p>\n<p>Even though 32-bit and 64-bit builds are supported, you’ll get away with 64-bit Mac and Windows apps. You will need 32-bit and 64-bit Linux apps, though, for compatibility.</p>\n<p>So, let’s say that Electron has won over and you want to ship an Electron app. There’s a nice Node.js module named <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager" rel="noopener">electron-packager</a> that helps with packing your app up into an <code>.app</code> or <code>.exe</code> file. A few similar projects exist, including interactive ones that prompt you step by step. You should use <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder" rel="noopener">electron-builder</a>, though, which builds on top of electron-packager, plus a few other related modules. It generates <code>.dmg</code>s and Windows installers and takes care of the code-signing of your app for you. This is really important. Without it, your app would be labelled as untrusted by operating systems, your app could trigger anti-virus software, and Microsoft SmartScreen might try to block the user from launching your app.</p>\n<p>The annoying thing about code-signing is that you have to sign your app on a Mac for Mac and on Windows for Windows. So, if you’re serious about shipping desktop apps, then you’ll need to build on multiple machines for each release.</p>\n<p>This can feel a bit too manual or tedious, especially if you’re used to creating for the web. Thankfully, electron-builder was created with automation in mind. I’m talking here about continuous integration tools and services such as <a href="https://jenkins.io/" rel="noopener">Jenkins</a>, <a href="http://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" rel="noopener">Travis-CI</a>, <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/" rel="noopener">AppVeyor</a> (for Windows) and so on. These could run your desktop app build at the press of a button or at every push to GitHub, for example.</p>\n<h3><a id="automatic-updates" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automatic-updates" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automatic Updates</h3>\n<p>NW.js doesn’t have automatic update support, but you’ll have access to all of Node.js, so you can do whatever you want. Open-source modules are out there for it, such as <a href="https://github.com/edjafarov/node-webkit-updater" rel="noopener">node-webkit-updater</a>, which handles downloading and replacing your app with a newer version. You could also roll your own custom system if you wanted.</p>\n<p>Electron has built-in support for automatic updates, via its <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/auto-updater/" rel="noopener">autoUpdater</a> API. It doesn’t support Linux, first of all; instead, publishing your app to Linux package managers is recommended. This is common on Linux — don’t worry. The <code>autoUpdater</code> API is really simple; once you give it a URL, you can call the <code>checkForUpdates</code> method. It’s event-driven, so you can subscribe to the <code>update-downloaded</code> event, for example, and once it’s fired, call the <code>restartAndInstall</code> method to install the new version and restart the app. You can listen for a few other events, which you can use to tie the auto-updating functionality into your user interface nicely.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You can have multiple update channels if you want, such as Google Chrome and Google Chrome Canary.</p>\n<p>It’s not quite as simple behind the API. It’s based on the Squirrel update framework, which differs drastically between Mac and Windows, which use the <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac" rel="noopener">Squirrel.Mac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows" rel="noopener">Squirrel.Windows</a> projects, respectively.</p>\n<p>The update code within your Mac Electron app is simple, but you’ll need a server (albeit a simple server). When you call the autoUpdater module’s <code>checkForUpdates</code> method, it will hit your server. What your server needs to do is return a 204 (“No Content”) if there isn’t an update; and if there is, it needs to return a 200 with a JSON containing a URL pointing to a <code>.zip</code> file. Back under the hood of your app (or the client), Squirrel.Mac will know what to do. It’ll go get that <code>.zip</code>, unzip it and fire the appropriate events.</p>\n<p>There a bit more (magic) going on in your Windows app when it comes to automatic updates. You won’t need a server, but you can have one if you’d like. You could host the static (update) files somewhere, such as AWS S3, or even have them locally on your machine, which is really handy for testing. Despite the differences between Squirrel.Mac and Squirrel.Windows, a happy medium can be found; for example, having a server for both, and storing the updates on S3 or somewhere similar.</p>\n<p>Squirrel.Windows has a couple of nice features over Squirrel.Mac as well. It applies updates in the background; so, when you call <code>restartAndInstall</code>, it’ll be a bit quicker because it’s ready and waiting. It also supports delta updates. Let’s say your app checks for updates and there is one newer version. A binary diff (between the currently installed app and the update) will be downloaded and applied as a patch to the current executable, instead of replacing it with a whole new app. It can even do that incrementally if you’re, say, three versions behind, but it will only do that if it’s worth it. Otherwise, if you’re, say, 15 versions behind, it will just download the latest version in its entirety instead. The great thing is that all of this is done under the hood for you. The API remains really simple. You check for updates, it will figure out the optimal method to apply the update, and it will let you know when it’s ready to go.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You will have to generate those binary diffs, though, and host them alongside your standard updates.

Let’s look at a few unexpected problems or gains you might come across along the way, some unexpected side effects of APIs you’re used to using on the web, workflow pain points, maintenance woes and more.</p>\n<p>Well, the first thing that comes to mind is browser lock-in. It’s like a guilty pleasure. If you’re making a desktop app exclusively, you’ll know exactly which Chromium version all of your users are on. Let your imagination run wild; you can use flexbox, ES6, pure WebSockets, WebRTC, anything you want. You can even enable experimental features in Chromium for your app (i.e. features coming down the line) or tweak settings such as your localStorage allowance. You’ll never have to deal with any cross-browser incompatibilities. This is on top of Node.js’ APIs and all of npm. You can do anything.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You’ll still have to consider which operating system the user is running sometimes, though, but OS-sniffing is a lot more reliable and less frowned upon than browser sniffing.</p>\n<h4><a id="working-with-file" class="post-header-anchor" href="#working-with-file" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Working With file://</h4>\n<p>Another interesting thing is that your app is essentially offline-first. Keep that in mind when creating your app; a user can launch your app without a network connection and your app will run; it will still load the local files. You’ll need to pay more attention to how your app behaves if the network connection is lost while it’s running. You may need to adjust your mindset.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: You can load remote URLs if you really want, but I wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>One tip I can give you here is not to trust <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine" rel="noopener"><code>navigator.onLine</code></a> completely. This property returns a Boolean indicating whether or not there’s a connection, but watch out for false positives. It’ll return <code>true</code> if there’s any local connection without validating that connection. The Internet might not actually be accessible; it could be fooled by a dummy connection to a Vagrant virtual machine on your machine, etc. Instead, use Sindre Sorhus’ <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-online" rel="noopener"><code>is-online</code></a> module to double-check; it will ping the Internet’s root servers and/or the favicon of a few popular websites. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> isOnline <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'is-online\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>navigator<span class="token punctuation">.</span>onLine<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token comment">// hmm there\'s a connection, but is the Internet accessible?</span>\n  <span class="token function">isOnline</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>online <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>online<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// true or false</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n<span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token comment">// we can trust navigator.onLine when it says there is no connection</span>\n  console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Speaking of local files, there are a few things to be aware of when using the <code>file://</code> protocol — protocol-less URLs, for one; you can’t use them anymore. I mean URLs that start with <code>//</code> instead of <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. Typically, if a web app requests <code>//example.com/hello.json</code>, then your browser would expand this to <code>http://example.com/hello.json</code> or to <code>https://example.com/hello.json</code> if the current page is loaded over HTTPS. In our app, the current page would load using the <code>file://</code> protocol; so, if we requested the same URL, it would expand to <code>file://example.com/hello.json</code> and fail. The real worry here is third-party modules you might be using; authors aren’t thinking of desktop apps when they make a library.</p>\n<p>You’d never use a CDN. Loading local files is basically instantaneous. There’s also no limit on the number of concurrent requests (per domain), like there is on the web (with HTTP/1.1 at least). You can load as many as you want in parallel.</p>\n<h4><a id="artifacts-galore" class="post-header-anchor" href="#artifacts-galore" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Artifacts Galore</h4>\n<p>A lot of asset generation is involved in creating a solid desktop app. You’ll need to generate executables and installers and decide on an auto-update system. Then, for each update, you’ll have to build the executables again, more installers (because if someone goes to your website to download it, they should get the latest version) and binary diffs for delta updates.</p>\n<p>Weight is still a concern. A “Hello, World!” Electron app is 40 MB zipped. Besides the typical advice you follow when creating a web app (write less code, minify it, have fewer dependencies, etc.), there isn’t much I can offer you. The “Hello, World!” app is literally an app containing one HTML file; most of the weight comes from the fact that Chromium and Node.js are baked into your app. At least delta updates will reduce how much is downloaded when a user performs an update (on Windows only, I’m afraid). However, your users won’t be downloading your app on a 2G connection (hopefully!).</p>\n<h4><a id="expect-the-unexpected" class="post-header-anchor" href="#expect-the-unexpected" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Expect the Unexpected</h4>\n<p>You will discover unexpected behavior now and again. Some of it is more obvious than the rest, but a little annoying nonetheless. For example, let’s say you’ve made a music player app that supports a mini-player mode, in which the window is really small and always in front of any other apps. If a user were to click or tap a dropdown (<code>&lt;select/&gt;</code>), then it would open to reveal its options, overflowing past the bottom edge of the app. If you were to use a non-native select library (such as select2 or chosen), though, you’re in trouble. When open, your dropdown will be cut off by the edge of your app. So, the user would see a few items and then nothing, which is really frustrating. This would happen in a web browser, too, but it’s not often the user would resize the window down to a small enough size.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/dropdownComparison.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/dropdownComparison.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Screenshots comparing what happens to a native dropdown versus a non-native one as they hit any edges of an app window.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>You may or may not know it, but on a Mac, every window has a header and a body. When a window isn’t focused, if you hover over an icon or button in the header, its appearance will reflect the fact that it’s being hovered over. For example, the close button on macOS is gray when the window is blurred but red when you hover over it. However, if you move your mouse over something in the body of the window, there is no visible change. This is intentional. Think about your desktop app, though; it’s Chromium missing the header, and your app is the web page, which is the body of the window. You could drop the native frame and create your own custom HTML buttons instead for minimize, maximize and close. If your window isn’t focused, though, they won’t react if you were to hover over them. Hover styles won’t be applied, and that feels really wrong. To make it worse, if you were to click the close button, for example, it would focus the window and that’s it. A second click would be required to actually click the button and close the app.</p>\n<p>To add insult to injury, Chromium has a bug that can mask the problem, making you think it works as you might have originally expected. If you move your mouse fast enough (nothing too unreasonable) from outside the window to an element inside the window, hover styles will be applied to that element. It’s a confirmed bug; applying the hover styles on a blurred window body “doesn’t meet platform expectations,” so it will be fixed. Hopefully, I’m saving you some heartbreak here. You could have a situation in which you’ve created beautiful custom window controls, yet in reality a lot of your users will be frustrated with your app (and will guess it’s not native).</p>\n<p>So, you must use native buttons on a Mac. There’s no way around that. For an NW.js app, you must enable the native frame, which is the default anyway (you can disable it by setting <code>window</code> object’s <code>frame</code> property to <code>false</code> in your <code>package.json</code>).</p>\n<p>You could do the same with an Electron app. This is controlled by setting the <code>frame</code> property when creating a window; for example, <code>new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, frame: true})</code>. As the Electron team does, they spotted this issue and added another option as a nice compromise; <code>titleBarStyle</code>. Setting this to <code>hidden</code> will hide the native title bar but keep the native window controls overlaid over the top-left corner of your app. This gets you around the problem of having non-native buttons on Mac, but you can still style the top of the app (and the area behind the buttons) however you like.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// main.js</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>app<span class="token punctuation">,</span> BrowserWindow<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'electron\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">let</span> mainWindow<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\napp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">on</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'ready\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  mainWindow <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">BrowserWindow</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    width<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">500</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    height<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">400</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    titleBarStyle<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'hidden\'</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  mainWindow<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">loadURL</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'file://\'</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> __dirname <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\'/index.html\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here’s an app in which I’ve disabled the title bar and given the <code>html</code> element a background image:</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/hiddenTitleBar.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/beyond-the-browser/hiddenTitleBar.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A screenshot of our example app without the title bar.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>See “<a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/frameless-window" rel="noopener">Frameless Window</a>” from Electron’s documentation for more.</p>\n<h4><a id="tooling" class="post-header-anchor" href="#tooling" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Tooling</h4>\n<p>Well, you can pretty much use all of the tooling you’d use to create a web app. Your app is just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, right? Plenty of plugins and modules are out there specifically for desktop apps, too, such as Gulp plugins for signing your app, for example (if you didn’t want to use electron-builder). <a href="https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect" rel="noopener">Electron-connect</a> watches your files for changes, and when they occur, it’ll inject those changes into your open window(s) or relaunch the app if it was your main script that was modified. It is Node.js, after all; you can pretty much do anything you’d like. You could run webpack inside your app if you wanted to — I’ve no idea why you would, but the options are endless.

First of all, the release flow is completely different. A significant mindset adjustment is required. When you’re working on the web app and you deploy a change that breaks something, it’s not really a huge deal (of course, that depends on your app and the bug). You can just roll out a fix. Users who reload or change the page and new users who trickle in will get the latest code. Developers under pressure might rush out a feature for a deadline and fix bugs as they’re reported or noticed. You can’t do that with desktop apps. You can’t take back updates you push out there. It’s more like a mobile app flow. You build the app, put it out there, and you can’t take it back. Some users might not even update from a buggy version to the fixed version. This will make you worry about all of the bugs out there in old versions.</p>\n<h4><a id="quantum-mechanics" class="post-header-anchor" href="#quantum-mechanics" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Quantum Mechanics</h4>\n<p>Because a host of different versions of your app are in use, your code will exist in multiple forms and states. Multiple variants of your client (desktop app) could be hitting your API in 10 slightly different ways. So, you’ll need to strongly consider versioning your API, really locking down and testing it well. When an API change is to be introduced, you might not be sure if it’s a breaking change or not. A version released a month ago could implode because it has some slightly different code.</p>\n<h4><a id="fresh-problems-to-solve" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fresh-problems-to-solve" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fresh Problems to Solve</h4>\n<p>You might receive a few strange bug reports — ones that involve bizarre user account arrangements, specific antivirus software or worse. I had a case in which a user had installed something (or had done something themselves) that messed with their system’s environment variables. This broke our app because a dependency we used for something critical failed to execute a system command because the command could no longer be found. This is a good example because there will be occasions when you’ll have to draw a line. This was something critical to our app, so we couldn’t ignore the error, and we couldn’t fix their machine. For users like this, a lot of their desktop apps would be somewhat broken at best. In the end, we decided to show a tailored error screen to the user if this unlikely error were ever to pop up again. It links to a document explaining why it has occurred and has a step-by-step guide to fix it.</p>\n<p>Sure, a few web-specific concerns are no longer applicable when you’re working on a desktop app, such as legacy browsers. You will have a few new ones to take into consideration, though. There’s a 256-character limit on file paths in Windows, for example.</p>\n<p>Old versions of npm store dependencies in a recursive file structure. Your dependencies would each get stored in their own directory within a <code>node_modules</code> directory in your project (for example, <code>node_modules/a</code>). If any of your dependencies have dependencies of their own, those grandchild dependencies would be stored in a <code>node_modules</code> within that directory (for example, <code>node_modules/a/node_modules/b</code>). Because Node.js and npm encourage small single-purpose modules, you could easily end up with a really long path, like <code>path/to/your/project/node_modules/a/node_modules/b/node_modules/c/.../n/index.js</code>.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: Since version 3, npm flattens out the dependency tree as much as possible. However, there are other causes for long paths.</p>\n<p>We had a case in which our app wouldn’t launch at all (or would crash soon after launching) on certain versions of Windows due to an exceeding long path. This was a major headache. With Electron, you can put all of your app’s code into an <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/application-packaging/" rel="noopener">asar archive</a>, which protects against path length issues but has exceptions and can’t always be used.</p>\n<p>We created a little Gulp plugin named <a href="https://github.com/Teamwork/gulp-path-length" rel="noopener">gulp-path-length</a>, which lets you know whether any dangerously long file paths are in your app. Where your app is stored on the end user’s machine will determine the true length of the path, though. In our case, our installer will install it to <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming</code>. So, when our app is built (locally by us or by a continuous integration service), gulp-path-length is instructed to audit our files as if they’re stored there (on the user’s machine with a long username, to be safe).</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">var</span> gulp <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'gulp\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">var</span> pathLength <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'gulp-path-length\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\ngulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">task</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'default\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">src</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'./example/**/*\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>read<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n        <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">pipe</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">pathLength</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t        rewrite<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t\t        match<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'./example\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n\t\t        replacement<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'C:\\\\Users\\\\this-is-a-long-username\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Teamwork Chat\\\\\'</span>\n\t        <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n        <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a id="fatal-errors-can-be-really-fatal" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fatal-errors-can-be-really-fatal" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fatal Errors Can Be Really Fatal</h4>\n<p>Because all of the automatic updates handling is done within the app, you could have an uncaught exception that crashes the app before it even gets to check for an update.

First of all, Google Analytics won’t work (out of the box, at least). You’ll have to find something that doesn’t mind an app that runs on <code>file://</code> URLs. If you’re using a tool to track errors, make sure to lock down errors by app version if the tool supports release-tracking. For example, if you’re using <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/" rel="noopener">Sentry</a> to track errors, make sure to <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/clients/javascript/config/#optional-settings" rel="noopener">set the <code>release</code> property when setting up your client</a>, so that errors will be split up by app version. Otherwise, if you receive a report about an error and roll out a fix, you’ll keep on receiving reports about the error, filling up your reports or logs with false positives. These errors will be coming from people using older versions.</p>\n<p>Electron has a <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/crash-reporter/" rel="noopener"><code>crashReporter</code></a> module, which will send you a report any time the app completely crashes (i.e. the entire app dies, not for any old error thrown). You can also listen for events indicating that your renderer process has become unresponsive.</p>\n<h4><a id="security" class="post-header-anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Security</h4>\n<p>Be extra-careful when accepting user input or even trusting third-party scripts, because a malicious individual could have a lot of fun with access to Node.js. Also, never accept user input and pass it to a native API or command without proper sanitation.</p>\n<p>Don’t trust code from vendors either. We had a problem recently with a third-party snippet we had included in our app for analytics, provided by company X. The team behind it rolled out an update with some dodgy code, thereby introducing a fatal error in our app. When a user launched our app, the snippet grabbed the newest JavaScript from their CDN and ran it. The error thrown prevented anything further from executing. Anyone with the app already running was unaffected, but if they were to quit it and launch it again, they’d have the problem, too. We contacted X’s support team and they promptly rolled out a fix. Our app was fine again once our users restarted it, but it was scary there for a while. We wouldn’t have been able to patch the problem ourselves without forcing affected users to manually download a new version of the app (with the snippet removed).</p>\n<p>How can you mitigate this risk? You could try to catch errors, but you’ve no idea what they company X might do in its JavaScript, so you’re better off with something more solid. You could add a level of abstraction. Instead of pointing directly to X’s URL from your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, you could use <a href="https://www.google.ie/analytics/tag-manager/" rel="noopener">Google Tag Manager</a> or your own API to return either HTML containing the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags or a single JavaScript file containing all of your third-party dependencies somehow. This would enable you to change which snippets get loaded (by tweaking Google Tag Manager or your API endpoint) without having to roll out a new update.</p>\n<p>However, if the API no longer returned the analytics snippet, the global variable created by the snippet would still be there in your code, trying to call undefined functions. So, we haven’t solved the problem entirely. Also, this API call would fail if a user launches the app without a connection. You don’t want to restrict your app when offline. Sure, you could use a cached result from the last time the request succeeded, but what if there was a bug in that version? You’re back to the same problem.</p>\n<p>Another solution would be to create a hidden window and load a (local) HTML file there that contains all of your third-party snippets. So, any global variables that the snippets create would be scoped to that window. Any errors thrown would be thrown in that window and your main window(s) would be unaffected. If you needed to use those APIs or global variables in your main window(s), you’d do this via IPC now. You’d send an event over IPC to your main process, which would then send it onto the hidden window, and if it was still healthy, it would listen for the event and call the third-party function. That would work.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to security. What if someone malicious at company X were to include some dangerous Node.js code in their JavaScript? We’d be rightly screwed. Luckily, Electron has a nice option to disable Node.js for a given window, so it simply wouldn’t run:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// main.js</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>app<span class="token punctuation">,</span> BrowserWindow<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'electron\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">let</span> thirdPartyWindow<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\napp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">on</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'ready\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  thirdPartyWindow <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">BrowserWindow</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    width<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">500</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    height<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">400</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    webPreferences<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n      nodeIntegration<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  thirdPartyWindow<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">loadURL</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'file://\'</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> __dirname <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\'/third-party-snippets.html\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a id="automated-testing" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automated-testing" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automated Testing</h4>\n<p>NW.js doesn’t have any built-in support for testing.

As a web developer, you have all of the tools required to make an app for either environment. Why not both? It takes a bit more effort, but it’s worth it. I’ll mention a few related topics and tools, which are complicated in their own right, so I’ll keep just touch on them.</p>\n<p>First of all, forget about “browser lock-in,” native WebSockets, etc. The same goes for ES6. You can either revert to writing plain old ES5 JavaScript or use something like <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="noopener">Babel</a> to transpile your ES6 into ES5, for web use.</p>\n<p>You also have <code>require</code>s throughout your code (for importing other scripts or modules), which a browser won’t understand. Use a module bundler that supports CommonJS (i.e. Node.js-style <code>require</code>s), such as <a href="http://rollupjs.org" rel="noopener">Rollup</a>, <a href="https://webpack.github.io" rel="noopener">webpack</a> or <a href="http://browserify.org" rel="noopener">Browserify</a>. When making a build for the web, a module bundler will run over your code, traverse all of the <code>require</code>s and bundle them up into one script for you.</p>\n<p>Any code using Node.js or Electron APIs (i.e. to write to disk or integrate with the desktop environment) should not be called when the app is running on the web. You can detect this by checking whether <code>process.version.nwjs</code> or <code>process.versions.electron</code> exists; if it does, then your app is currently running in the desktop environment.</p>\n<p>Even then, you’ll be loading a lot of redundant code in the web app. Let’s say you have a <code>require</code> guarded behind a check like <code>if(app.isInDesktop)</code>, along with a big chunk of desktop-specific code. Instead of detecting the environment at runtime and setting <code>app.isInDesktop</code>, you could pass <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> into your app as a flag at buildtime (for example, using the <a href="https://github.com/hughsk/envify" rel="noopener">envify</a> transform for Browserify). This will aide your module bundler of choice when it’s doing its static analysis and tree-shaking (i.e. dead-code elimination). It will now know whether <code>app.isInDesktop</code> is <code>true</code>. So, if you’re running your web build, it won’t bother going inside that <code>if</code> statement or traversing the <code>require</code> in question.</p>\n<h4><a id="continuous-delivery" class="post-header-anchor" href="#continuous-delivery" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Continuous Delivery</h4>\n<p>There’s that release mindset again; it’s challenging. When you’re working on the web, you want to be able to roll out changes frequently. I believe in continually delivering small incremental changes that can be rolled back quickly. Ideally, with enough testing, an intern can push a little tweak to your master branch, resulting in your web app being automatically tested and deployed.</p>\n<p>As we covered earlier, you can’t really do this with a desktop app. OK, I guess you technically could if you’re using Electron, because electron-builder can be automated and, so, can spectron tests. I don’t know anyone doing this, and I wouldn’t have enough faith to do it myself. Remember, broken code can’t be taken back, and you could break the update flow. Besides, you don’t want to deliver desktop updates too often anyway. Updates aren’t silent, like they are on the web, so it’s not very nice for the user. Plus, for users on macOS, delta updates aren’t supported, so users would be downloading a full new app for each release, no matter how small a tweak it has.</p>\n<p>You’ll have to find a balance. A happy medium might be to release all fixes to the web as soon as possible and release a desktop app weekly or monthly — unless you’re releasing a feature, that is. You don’t want to punish a user because they chose to install your desktop app. Nothing’s worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realize that you’ll have to wait a while longer than everyone else. You could employ a feature-flags API to roll out features on both platforms at the same time, but that’s a whole separate topic. I first learned of feature flags from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">Continuous Delivery: The Dirty Details</a>,” a talk by Etsy’s VP of Engineering, Mike Brittain.</p>\n<h3><a id="conclusion" class="post-header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>So, there you have it. With minimal effort, you can add “desktop app developer” to your resumé. We’ve looked at creating your first modern desktop app, packaging, distribution, after-sales service and a lot more. Hopefully, despite the pitfalls and horror stories I’ve shared, you’ll agree that it’s not as scary as it seems. You already have what it takes. All you need to do is look over some API documentation. Thanks to a few new powerful APIs at your disposal, you can get the most value from your skills as a web developer.

Well I suppose *some* might oblige, but that depends on a host of factors. This is what permissions requests are like on the web. Let's take a look at how we can do better, before it's too late. Side note: a phone number is like a SnapChat username to your parents.\n\n:::\n\nWe sure can build amazing experiences these days. We can leverage powerful browser APIs to access  users' location, send them notifications (whether your site is open or not), interact with MIDI devices, and a lot more. We didn't get here on our own though. A lot of these capabilities came to other platforms first. We are in our own league when it comes to UX and engagement however. Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.\n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png Chris Wilson, [The New Bar for Web Experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ) (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)\n:::\n\nAt the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It's understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I'd position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.\n\nExamples aren't needed because we've all experienced it. It's not so bad if it's obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. [Peter-Paul Koch argued](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html) that the web shouldn't emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren't at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).\n\n\n### Why should I care?\n\nWell, the user's experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it's a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren't achieving what you set out to; users aren't accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.\n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg What the permissions prompt looks like in Chrome 63.\n:::\n\nChrome 63 (mobile) [adds fuel to the fire](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/). Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.\n\nWhat will browsers do if we don't improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already [removed the notification centre](https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/) citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.\n\n\n### When should I request access to these APIs?\n\nDon't. Just don't. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you're playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you're asking right away because it's critical to your app, I'd re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you'd have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even https://webcamtests.com/ doesn't immediately ask for access to your webcam.\n\nIf you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they're immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask *when* you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they'd like to receive notifications of new articles after they'd read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user's browsers supports a feature, doesn't mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.\n\n\n### The double request pattern\n\nIf you are going to interrupt the user (and that's what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance. You may only get one attempt. Clicking \"Block\" in Google Chrome is permanent, unless the user goes and manually overrides it for your site in Chrome's settings. Other browsers have a \"Remember this choice\" checkbox which results in the same thing.  \n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/google-calendar.png Google Calendar's fake UI prompt for notifications\n:::\n\nThis is where the double request pattern from mobile-land comes in. Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it's rejected or ignored, then fine. You're not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don't bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.\n\nRequests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar's fake notification prompt is a good example.\n\nYou were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar's one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app's settings would be even better (although they're not mutually exclusively). Allowing the user to opt-in like that is surely the pattern with the highest success rate.\n\n\n#### The permissions API\n\nOne problem with using fake UI is knowing whether or not the user has already granted the permission. You don't want to show the popup again on every visit and if it's an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; `Notification.permission` will either be `granted`, `denied`, or `prompt`. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven't got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.\n \nThe [Permissions API](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/) comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API. For example:\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' })\n  .then((result) -> {\n\t  if(result.status === 'granted'){\n\t    // They've granted permission previously\n\t  }\n\t  // Otherwise result.status is 'denied' or 'prompt'\n  })\n  .catch((error) -> {\n    /* \n     * The permission state cannot be checked. \n     * E.g. Firefox didn't support the persistent-storage permission name until Firefox 53\n     */\n  });\n```\n\nFor some APIs, permissions aren't as simple though so you can provide some context when querying;\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.permissions.query({ name: 'midi', sysex: true })\n  // ...\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the Permissions API is currently only supported in Chrome (43+) and Firefox (46+). When a permission is explicitly granted or denied, you can store that information in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) (or elsewhere) as a fallback. Then you can look up the permission's state there instead of querying it using the Permission API.\n\nThe [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions) also describes similar methods for requesting and revoking permissions. No browser supports the former and the latter is only supported in Firefox (47+);\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.permissions.revoke({ name: 'microphone' })\n  // ...\n```\n\n\n### Incentivize the user\n\nTo encourage the user to opt-in, you could explain that they will be rewarded in some way. It's to you what that reward could be. Alternatively, you could just use gamification. For example, you could show an on-boarding checklist somewhere in your app, containing \"Enable notifications\" and anything else you'd like. Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications. Don't blackmail users though; don't block them from using certain features until they've granted a permission or signed up for your newsletter or anything like that.\n\n\n### What if the native request is rejected?\n\nIt's unlikely but there is a chance the user could still reject access once the native prompt is shown (or ignore it). If this happens, you should show some feedback and explain how to manually enable the permission via their browser settings (or link to an explanation).\n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/whatsapp.png The overlay WhatsApp (web) shows when the native prompt is shown.\n:::\n\nWe can do more than cross our fingers though. When the user interacts with your fake UI and you're about to trigger the native prompt, you could show something to guide them. It could even be an overlay which covers the entire page. By doing this, you can draw more attention to the prompt, prevent it being ignored, and even show some text. I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked. I'd keep this overlay simple though. You shouldn't assume where the native prompt will appear, browser-sniff, or have too much code here in general.\n\n\n### Be reasonable\n\nWhat you do once they enable the permission is another story. First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it's notifications they're granting, [don't go overboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo). There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications. My favourite part is that it defaults to sending you a notification for every message but once you've settled into app, it recommends reducing your notification level so you'll only get notified when you're @mentioned.\n\nDon't send the user multiple notifications for the same thing. Even if I've your app is open in 20 tabs, I should only get one notification per event. The Notification API allows you to provide a \"tag\" to achieve this;\n\n```javascript\nnew Notification(\"New email from ...\", { \n  body: \"Hey, how are you? I was wondering...\",\n  tag: \"1\" \n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nIf multiple notifications are created with the same tag (e.g. an email ID), the user will only receive one.\n\n\n### Be pragmatic\n\nYou don't need to do *all* of this. It depends how important the permission in question is to your site. The web would be a better place if everyone applied even a little bit of this.\n\n::: quote Peter Drucker\nIf you can't measure it, you can't improve it.\n:::\n\nFor each permission or feature, track engagement and acceptance, how far users get before rejecting a permission, etc. This is a conversion funnel like any other. You can then tweak it and A/B test.\n\n\n### Dear browsers\n\nHelp us out. Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done. \n\nMaybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user's microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.\n\nNow let's take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn't allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a \"user gesture\" such as a touch or click. \n\nChrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins ([like other features](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins)), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn't in response to a user gesture. Can't we just enforce this for any permissions request?\n\nChrome's rules around accessing persistent-storage aren't as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:\n\n- The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)\n- The site has high site engagement\n- The site has been added to home screen\n- The site has push notifications enabled\n\nOtherwise, the permission is automatically denied. \n\nI'm not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on *some* rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.\n\nP.S. I noticed there's now a [Dialog API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog); it would be nice to add some rules here too before it gets too popular and people are using it to display ads the second you hit their page. \n\n\n### Introducing AskBlocker\n\nI've been thinking about writing this for a long time and it was Jason Grigsby's [Time to Update Your Permissions UX](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/) post that inspired me to actually do it. Not only did it turn out to be much longer than I expected, but I brought more work on myself by deciding to create browser extensions as well. \n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/askblocker.png AskBlocker for Chrome (screenshot)\n:::\n\n[AskBlocker](https://adamlynch.com/askblocker/) is an extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave, which keeps permissions requests in check. Permissions requests are blocked until you've interacted with the page (i.e. click, tap, or key press), with the following exceptions:\n\n- If the permission has been previously requested and granted (or explicitly denied).\n- If the domain is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.\n- If you've navigated to the current page from another page on the same domain.\n\nThis will at least block immediate requests to enable notifications the first time you go a site. You can see the requests which were caught and whitelist them (it will ask again and reload, to be safe). It's [open-source](https://github.com/adam-lynch/askblocker).\n\nNote: There aren't any extensions for other browsers (yet) because they don't support the Permissions API. \n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- We can learn lessons from mobile development and more.\n- Users aren't granting permissions requests.\n- It's no longer possible to dismiss requests in Google Chrome's mobile apps.\n- We looked at how to improve your permissions UX and increase acceptance rate; the keys are discipline, context, timing, measuring, and trust, among others.\n- Browsers, please help.\n- Try out [AskBlocker](https://adamlynch.com/askblocker).\n",unfilteredRenderedBody:'<h2><a id="how-to-improve-your-permissions-ux" class="post-header-anchor" href="#how-to-improve-your-permissions-ux" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>How to improve your permissions UX</h2>\n<article-summary><p>&quot;Welcome to Costco, can I have your phone number?&quot; Most people would refuse, right? Well I suppose <em>some</em> might oblige, but that depends on a host of factors. This is what permissions requests are like on the web. Let\'s take a look at how we can do better, before it\'s too late. Side note: a phone number is like a SnapChat username to your parents.</p>\n</article-summary><p>We sure can build amazing experiences these days. We can leverage powerful browser APIs to access  users\' location, send them notifications (whether your site is open or not), interact with MIDI devices, and a lot more. We didn\'t get here on our own though. A lot of these capabilities came to other platforms first. We are in our own league when it comes to UX and engagement however. Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Chris Wilson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ" rel="noopener">The New Bar for Web Experiences</a> (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>At the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It\'s understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I\'d position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.</p>\n<p>Examples aren\'t needed because we\'ve all experienced it. It\'s not so bad if it\'s obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html" rel="noopener">Peter-Paul Koch argued</a> that the web shouldn\'t emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren\'t at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).</p>\n<h3><a id="why-should-i-care" class="post-header-anchor" href="#why-should-i-care" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Why should I care?</h3>\n<p>Well, the user\'s experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it\'s a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren\'t achieving what you set out to; users aren\'t accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>What the permissions prompt looks like in Chrome 63.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Chrome 63 (mobile) <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">adds fuel to the fire</a>. Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.</p>\n<p>What will browsers do if we don\'t improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/" rel="noopener">removed the notification centre</a> citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.</p>\n<h3><a id="when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" class="post-header-anchor" href="#when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>When should I request access to these APIs?</h3>\n<p>Don\'t. Just don\'t. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you\'re playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you\'re asking right away because it\'s critical to your app, I\'d re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you\'d have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even <a href="https://webcamtests.com/" rel="noopener">https://webcamtests.com/</a> doesn\'t immediately ask for access to your webcam.</p>\n<p>If you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they\'re immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask <em>when</em> you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they\'d like to receive notifications of new articles after they\'d read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user\'s browsers supports a feature, doesn\'t mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-double-request-pattern" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-double-request-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The double request pattern</h3>\n<p>If you are going to interrupt the user (and that\'s what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance.

Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it\'s rejected or ignored, then fine. You\'re not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don\'t bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.</p>\n<p>Requests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar\'s fake notification prompt is a good example.</p>\n<p>You were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar\'s one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app\'s settings would be even better (although they\'re not mutually exclusively).

You don\'t want to show the popup again on every visit and if it\'s an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; <code>Notification.permission</code> will either be <code>granted</code>, <code>denied</code>, or <code>prompt</code>. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven\'t got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/permissions/" rel="noopener">Permissions API</a> comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API.

It\'s to you what that reward could be. Alternatively, you could just use gamification. For example, you could show an on-boarding checklist somewhere in your app, containing &quot;Enable notifications&quot; and anything else you\'d like. Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications.

I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked.

First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it\'s notifications they\'re granting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo" rel="noopener">don\'t go overboard</a>. There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications. My favourite part is that it defaults to sending you a notification for every message but once you\'ve settled into app, it recommends reducing your notification level so you\'ll only get notified when you\'re @mentioned.</p>\n<p>Don\'t send the user multiple notifications for the same thing.

Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done.</p>\n<p>Maybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user\'s microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.</p>\n<p>Now let\'s take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn\'t allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a &quot;user gesture&quot; such as a touch or click.</p>\n<p>Chrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins" rel="noopener">like other features</a>), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn\'t in response to a user gesture. Can\'t we just enforce this for any permissions request?</p>\n<p>Chrome\'s rules around accessing persistent-storage aren\'t as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)</li>\n<li>The site has high site engagement</li>\n<li>The site has been added to home screen</li>\n<li>The site has push notifications enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Otherwise, the permission is automatically denied.</p>\n<p>I\'m not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on <em>some</em> rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.</p>\n<p>P.S. I noticed there\'s now a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog" rel="noopener">Dialog API</a>; it would be nice to add some rules here too before it gets too popular and people are using it to display ads the second you hit their page.</p>\n<h3><a id="introducing-askblocker" class="post-header-anchor" href="#introducing-askblocker" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Introducing AskBlocker</h3>\n<p>I\'ve been thinking about writing this for a long time and it was Jason Grigsby\'s <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">Time to Update Your Permissions UX</a> post that inspired me to actually do it.

Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Chris Wilson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ" rel="noopener">The New Bar for Web Experiences</a> (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>At the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It\'s understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I\'d position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.</p>\n<p>Examples aren\'t needed because we\'ve all experienced it. It\'s not so bad if it\'s obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html" rel="noopener">Peter-Paul Koch argued</a> that the web shouldn\'t emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren\'t at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).</p>\n<h3><a id="why-should-i-care" class="post-header-anchor" href="#why-should-i-care" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Why should I care?</h3>\n<p>Well, the user\'s experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it\'s a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren\'t achieving what you set out to; users aren\'t accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>What the permissions prompt looks like in Chrome 63.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Chrome 63 (mobile) <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">adds fuel to the fire</a>. Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.</p>\n<p>What will browsers do if we don\'t improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/" rel="noopener">removed the notification centre</a> citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.</p>\n<h3><a id="when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" class="post-header-anchor" href="#when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>When should I request access to these APIs?</h3>\n<p>Don\'t. Just don\'t. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you\'re playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you\'re asking right away because it\'s critical to your app, I\'d re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you\'d have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even <a href="https://webcamtests.com/" rel="noopener">https://webcamtests.com/</a> doesn\'t immediately ask for access to your webcam.</p>\n<p>If you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they\'re immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask <em>when</em> you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they\'d like to receive notifications of new articles after they\'d read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user\'s browsers supports a feature, doesn\'t mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-double-request-pattern" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-double-request-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The double request pattern</h3>\n<p>If you are going to interrupt the user (and that\'s what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance. You may only get one attempt. Clicking &quot;Block&quot; in Google Chrome is permanent, unless the user goes and manually overrides it for your site in Chrome\'s settings. Other browsers have a &quot;Remember this choice&quot; checkbox which results in the same thing.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/google-calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/google-calendar.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Google Calendar\'s fake UI prompt for notifications</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>This is where the double request pattern from mobile-land comes in. Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it\'s rejected or ignored, then fine. You\'re not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don\'t bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.</p>\n<p>Requests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar\'s fake notification prompt is a good example.</p>\n<p>You were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar\'s one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app\'s settings would be even better (although they\'re not mutually exclusively). Allowing the user to opt-in like that is surely the pattern with the highest success rate.</p>\n<h4><a id="the-permissions-api" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-permissions-api" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The permissions API</h4>\n<p>One problem with using fake UI is knowing whether or not the user has already granted the permission. You don\'t want to show the popup again on every visit and if it\'s an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; <code>Notification.permission</code> will either be <code>granted</code>, <code>denied</code>, or <code>prompt</code>. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven\'t got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/permissions/" rel="noopener">Permissions API</a> comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">navigator<span class="token punctuation">.</span>permissions<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">query</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> name<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'notifications\'</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>result<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t  <span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>result<span class="token punctuation">.</span>status <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">\'granted\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t    <span class="token comment">// They\'ve granted permission previously</span>\n\t  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n\t  <span class="token comment">// Otherwise result.status is \'denied\' or \'prompt\'</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token comment">/* \n     * The permission state cannot be checked. \n     * E.g.

Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications.

I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked.

First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it\'s notifications they\'re granting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo" rel="noopener">don\'t go overboard</a>. There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications.

Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done.</p>\n<p>Maybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user\'s microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.</p>\n<p>Now let\'s take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn\'t allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a &quot;user gesture&quot; such as a touch or click.</p>\n<p>Chrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins" rel="noopener">like other features</a>), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn\'t in response to a user gesture. Can\'t we just enforce this for any permissions request?</p>\n<p>Chrome\'s rules around accessing persistent-storage aren\'t as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)</li>\n<li>The site has high site engagement</li>\n<li>The site has been added to home screen</li>\n<li>The site has push notifications enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Otherwise, the permission is automatically denied.</p>\n<p>I\'m not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on <em>some</em> rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.</p>\n<p>P.S. I noticed there\'s now a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog" rel="noopener">Dialog API</a>; it would be nice to add some rules here too before it gets too popular and people are using it to display ads the second you hit their page.</p>\n<h3><a id="introducing-askblocker" class="post-header-anchor" href="#introducing-askblocker" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Introducing AskBlocker</h3>\n<p>I\'ve been thinking about writing this for a long time and it was Jason Grigsby\'s <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">Time to Update Your Permissions UX</a> post that inspired me to actually do it.
