<p>I've been thinking about team leading a lot lately. When revisiting advice a friend asked for when transitioning to a team lead position, I decided to flesh it out and put it online. Most of the following will hopefully be helpful to anyone leading a team or any manager, although some will be more relevant to leaders of developers and developers transitioning into leadership roles. If it helps anyone, great. It will be a good reference for me at least. Alright, let's get to it.</p>

<p>I've struggled with this and have seen almost every person in a leadership position struggle with it as well, but trust me, it's really worth getting over. If someone can do something 80% as well as you or better, delegate! Focus on the stuff only you can do. Don't feel like you have to touch everything and be the best or most active person on the team. You're responsible for making sure everyone else does their best and grows.</p>
<p>If you don't delegate enough, people feel like they're only doing the boring stuff and they'll feel undervalued as a result. They'll find somewhere they can have more impact and feel more valued. You'll be stressed because everyone is asking you to make a decision. Key decisions will stall as they wait for your call. The team will already have enough dependencies, which you're trying to resolve; don't become one.</p>
<p>Always try to find more ways to delegate. Don't just give people work to do in small orchestrated pieces. It makes people more reliant on you. They learn less. Although it is hard when you know how to do it and they're still learning. Delegate decision making for a particular problem to the right person. People love autonomy. Try to ask yourself if the right people are looking at a problem so the best possible decision can be made. Show people how <em>they</em> can safely spread responsibilities and knowledge.</p>
<p>Make yourself as redundant in the day-to-day work as possible. Ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, experience to get things done. You don't need to have the final say on everything and solve every hard problem. This gives you more time to work on the stuff only you can do.</p>
<p>On the flip side, as you start to delegate more, you will become less familiar with the actual code and feel like more of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" rel="noopener">imposter</a>. Don't let this stop you from delegating though.</p>

<p>Keep the team as efficient as possible. Protect them from distractions. For example, this also includes telling them about potential disruptive process changes being considered and meetings they'd like to be in but really don't need to be.</p>
<p>Emphasise knowledge sharing. Avoid someone fixing bugs related to X because they implemented X originally. Single points of failure are hard to avoid. People love to own their work. Taking responsibility is good but often leads to one person holding exclusive knowledge of something. Give someone territory and they'll likely become defensive.</p>
<p>Unblock the team, address issues that are holding back the team or individuals; dependencies, external issues like blocking stakeholders, lack of knowledge, etc. Reduce friction. Always look for ways to make your team's life easier so they can do their best work. Shield them from company politics, pointless meetings, and other distractions. Resolve disagreements.</p>
<p>Get the most out of different personalities. Understand what individuals need to perform optimally. Compromise, cultivate a team spirit. Promote continuous integration.</p>
<p>Determine the type of lead you will be. Don't identify yourself or become a title / dependency. This will only limit team members. The title isn't an excuse to micro-manage. Don't read into the word "lead" too much. People shouldn't be at your mercy or at your beck and call. Focus on getting to a point where everyone can learn from each other and get their best possible work done.</p>
<p>Keep an ear to the ground. Too much talk within the team might indicate a lack of productivity, decision making, or that they're enjoying themselves too much. If it's a bit too quiet, it might mean everyone is head down and there'll be problems once their code is integrated, or that people might not be getting along.</p>

<p>You have to be an excellent communicator. There's no room for negotiation here. Be assertive, be clear, and be honest.</p>
<p>Being specific and confident in what you're saying about a task is critical. You can't rely on intention. People will do exactly as you say. Discover and minimize misunderstandings early. The same goes for your interactions with stakeholders; play your part and remove ambiguity when it appears.</p>
<p>This is a simple one but when messaging a team member about having a chat with them, give them a rough idea what it's about in advance.</p>

          <figcaption><p>A beautiful line graph showing that the "importance of giving heads up" is inversely proportional to "frequency of contact". Watch out for "The 'OMG I'm getting fired' zone" if contact is minimal.</p>
</figcaption>
        </figure><p>Disagreements aren't criticism. They're healthy as long as they don't block progression or damage relationships. Don't be mean, but say what you mean, early. Make sure everyone has a fair say. There's always a better way but what is the most feasible solution right now? Try to get agreement from everyone and ensure everyone understands the outcome.</p>
<p>Encourage your team to challenge you, to tell you when you're wrong, but respectfully. The last thing you want is for them to be afraid to point out when you're wrong. Be your own harshest critic. Be honest when you don't know X and don't be afraid to admit you're learning. <em>Everyone is</em>.</p>
<p>You need to be serious and firm when giving criticism. If you're too lenient, it's harder to say something isn't acceptable later. The culture and standards of the team come from what you tolerate and promote.</p>

</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Don't spend time debating that which doesn't warrant it. Once you have good people, trust that they've looked into what they're talking about, that they've looked at the details. Don't second guess the small stuff. When there's a disagreement over a decision, be honest about how much you care about the outcome. If it's 2/10 for you but 9/10 for them, let it go. This is related to having a personal attachment to details ("perfectionism") but I'll leave that for another post.</p>

<p>Represent your team. Voice their concerns and share updates with them. Celebrate and recognise their hard work and achievements. Protect your team. Be an umbrella. Take negative criticism for them and only pass it down if they really need to hear it. Having anyone as a lead makes the team stronger, no matter who it is. Someone can stand up for the team and make things happen. Under promise, over deliver.</p>
<p>You now represent "the man". Understand top-down decisions; you need to in order to believe in them, and to then make others believe in them. Support your superiors. If they don't understand the challenges you're facing, that's your fault. Give them more situational awareness. Support them. Make them look good.</p>
<p>Manage stakeholder expectations as well as internal perspectives of your team and their work. Criticise team members if they're less than nice with other teams, for example. They're representing the team. Larger organisations can be tough as not everyone will respect the work being done by your team. Avoid pointing fingers or blaming other teams. I could benefit from being more savvy when it comes to politics but that's not what I'm about. You're all on the same side, act like it. When listing our values at <a href="http://teamwork.com/" rel="noopener">Teamwork</a>, the following is often cited as a good example:</p>

<p>Don't go overboard on process. Start small, experiment, keep what works. Team members' past experiences and opinions will vary a lot. Make it clear that the process is evolving and can always be improved with a suggestion from a team member. Each team is different, you'll discover the best processes. Set as few rules as possible and strive for minimal viable bureaucracy or process.</p>

</cite></footer></blockquote><p>I'd recommend doing daily standups. They're really good when done properly. It should ideally be at the same time everyday, as early as possible. If everyone is in the same location, actually stand (otherwise people go on too long). If one person is remote, everyone should connect to the video call separately and ensure sound quality is good. If someone's late without notice / rescheduling it, start without them. Listen to each other, otherwise there isn't much point. People shouldn't go into too much detail or interject when others are talking. If a discussion needs to happen, finish the standup first, then anyone can stay for the discussion if they want. To sum up, keep it short and efficient.</p>
<p>Schedule a regular chat with each person individually. Give them a chance to highlight successes or issues. This could be related to code, colleagues, your leadership, the company, home life, etc. Listen, empathise. Make sure you're up to speed on the work beforehand; it should be about them, not a status update for you. This is a good time to give feedback but keep it light. Try to give good with the bad. These conversations are really good; you'll be surprised by what comes up or how honest people will be. A lot of the time, the person will point out what they could improve on before you even get to it.</p>

<p>The role is people oriented, and people problems are not trivial. Even the toughest bugs are a lot more straight-forward to solve than "How can I keep this person happy?" Keeping morale high has to be a focus and part of that is mixing the right people. Each individual person can differ in what drives them, in their skills, weaknesses, experiences, standards, and more. Getting great people in your team is key. Worries about how best to educate and manage fade away and you're left to figure out how best to delegate.</p>
<p>You will have opinionated team members and you'll have to drag words out of others. Developers tend to provide solutions and opinions rather than facts. This can lead to heated discussions. Monitor these. Get to a solution with healthy tension and without damaging relationships.</p>
<p>You also need to give people space to grow though. It's tempting to solve problems for people but you should step back and let people fail. Failure is part of the learning process. Notice when people are happy to stay in their comfort zone. Encourage them to improve their weak areas and clear their path. Make developers around you better. It's a sign of a great senior developer.</p>
<p>Prepare to have to explain rationales for things. Don't get frustrated that people won't just do what you say. Explain. They'll learn from that. On the other hand, keep an eye out for people who have a problem with authority or taking over others' work / legacy code. There are times where all of us have to do something we don't like and people like this are less likely to improve their attitude in my experience.</p>

<p>Even though the role is certainly people oriented, people come and go, what we build remains. You might be used to coming up with elegant solutions to clear problems as a developer, but you will now have to resolve hazy problems with far reaching solutions. Focus on the long term when it comes to a design decision. Is this solution advancing us towards our overall goals? Is it compatible with foreseeable future changes? You don't want to make a decision that makes it more difficult to make changes or add features later. Strongly consider long-term maintainability, architecture, deployment, stability, availability, scalability, and so on. Think about the whole ecosystem of apps, alignment, etc.</p>
<p>It's important to still be hands-on with code though. Some lessons can only be learned this way. Keep in touch, stay up to date, be respected. Identify patterns over time and keep an eye out for anyone implementing a pattern which'll come back to haunt us. Be careful when dropping the team lead role to play full-time developer on the other hand, other unnoticed issues might bubble up until they are too big to solve quickly.</p>
<p>In general, I'd promote test-driven development, as well as continuous integration, deployment, and delivery. Check out Steve Smith's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afEzqDExCTE" rel="noopener">Measuring Continuous Delivery</a> talk if you haven't seen it. You should also measure app performance, feature usage, and so on. Don't go overboard but carefully select a few key metrics to begin with.</p>
<p>Let the team influence code style. I absolutely hate arguments over code style, e.g. tabs vs spaces. Discuss as a team and agree, but keep it short. Document the outcome. It shouldn't be acceptable to argue about it in pull requests; code either matches the code style or not. Plan a separate time to discuss a change to the code style if needed. Where possible, use linting tools which automatically formats code as it's written or pre-commit, e.g. <a href="https://prettier.io/" rel="noopener">Prettier</a>.</p>
<p>Monitor gaps in the team and knowledge, fill them. If a new developer joins the team with valuable insights or coding style,  re-align the team / integrate that.</p>
<p>It's easy to get sucked into the current work and dragged into the weeds but try to stay ahead of the team. Look at what's coming down the line, find problems, solutions, prototype. Steer the technical direction based on these discoveries. This, like everything else, is a lot of easier once you have great team members which you trust.</p>

<p>The transition is not easy. It's a lonely role and your context will be unique. Even others in the same role in different teams in the organization will have different values and problems to solve. Relationships will change. There is a change of perspective from working alongside people to managing them while working alongside them.</p>
<p>You'll find yourself reframing conversations not to offend anyone, more than you'd like. You need to bring positive energy even when you don't feel like it. Expect to have to give a lot of yourself, to facilitate, especially when the problem is unclear or complex. It's a bit lonelier. On the other hand, you get to see the whole picture. You get to step back and have more influence on the success of the company.</p>
<p>Time management is difficult. There are a lot of interruptions and context-switching. Some of these interruptions will be from other teams; everyone else has priorities and everything needs to be done ASAP, but you have to think of your priorities. The person shouting the loudest shouldn't necessarily always get your attention first.</p>
<p>Writing code and dealing with other issues is always going to clash. Deciding to be a tech lead means less coding, unless you work longer hours (but this isn't sustainable). There's less time to focus on a problem as a result and it's hard to measure your own performance. It's just not as tangible. As much as you'd like to shut your door to focus, you must be accessible to your team. You might find yourself coming in early, staying late, or working on the weekend. This again ties into delegating and the imposter syndrome.</p>

<p>I'm no expert and I don't get everything right. I have been leading teams for just a few years, but I have also had a broad range of experiences; all sorts of management styles (good and bad), tiny startups, large corporate companies, and more. My current role is "product lead" at <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/" rel="noopener">Teamwork</a> which is like a product manager, project manger, technical lead, and lead developer rolled into one.</p>
<p>There are far too many people to thank for their hand in my role and this advice. Managers I've had, many authors of books, articles, and speakers. Thank you! If something I said doesn't feel right, that's OK. You can read as much as you like on the topic, but a lot of it comes with experience. Feel it out. Try things, make a few mistakes, learn from them.</p>

When revisiting advice a friend asked for when transitioning to a team lead position, I decided to flesh it out and put it online. Most of the following will hopefully be helpful to anyone leading a team or any manager, although some will be more relevant to leaders of developers and developers transitioning into leadership roles. If it helps anyone, great. It will be a good reference for me at least. Alright, let's get to it.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Delegate, delegate, delegate!\n\nI've struggled with this and have seen almost every person in a leadership position struggle with it as well, but trust me, it's really worth getting over. If someone can do something 80% as well as you or better, delegate! Focus on the stuff only you can do. Don't feel like you have to touch everything and be the best or most active person on the team. You're responsible for making sure everyone else does their best and grows.\n\nIf you don't delegate enough, people feel like they're only doing the boring stuff and they'll feel undervalued as a result. They'll find somewhere they can have more impact and feel more valued. You'll be stressed because everyone is asking you to make a decision. Key decisions will stall as they wait for your call. The team will already have enough dependencies, which you're trying to resolve; don't become one.\n\nAlways try to find more ways to delegate. Don't just give people work to do in small orchestrated pieces. It makes people more reliant on you. They learn less. Although it is hard when you know how to do it and they're still learning. Delegate decision making for a particular problem to the right person. People love autonomy. Try to ask yourself if the right people are looking at a problem so the best possible decision can be made. Show people how *they* can safely spread responsibilities and knowledge.\n\nMake yourself as redundant in the day-to-day work as possible. Ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, experience to get things done. You don't need to have the final say on everything and solve every hard problem. This gives you more time to work on the stuff only you can do.\n\nOn the flip side, as you start to delegate more, you will become less familiar with the actual code and feel like more of an [imposter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). Don't let this stop you from delegating though.\n\n\n### Efficiency\n\nKeep the team as efficient as possible. Protect them from distractions. For example, this also includes telling them about potential disruptive process changes being considered and meetings they'd like to be in but really don't need to be.\n\nEmphasise knowledge sharing. Avoid someone fixing bugs related to X because they implemented X originally. Single points of failure are hard to avoid. People love to own their work. Taking responsibility is good but often leads to one person holding exclusive knowledge of something. Give someone territory and they'll likely become defensive.\n\nUnblock the team, address issues that are holding back the team or individuals; dependencies, external issues like blocking stakeholders, lack of knowledge, etc. Reduce friction. Always look for ways to make your team's life easier so they can do their best work. Shield them from company politics, pointless meetings, and other distractions. Resolve disagreements.\n\nGet the most out of different personalities. Understand what individuals need to perform optimally. Compromise, cultivate a team spirit. Promote continuous integration.\n\nDetermine the type of lead you will be. Don't identify yourself or become a title / dependency. This will only limit team members. The title isn't an excuse to micro-manage. Don't read into the word \"lead\" too much. People shouldn't be at your mercy or at your beck and call. Focus on getting to a point where everyone can learn from each other and get their best possible work done.\n\nKeep an ear to the ground. Too much talk within the team might indicate a lack of productivity, decision making, or that they're enjoying themselves too much. If it's a bit too quiet, it might mean everyone is head down and there'll be problems once their code is integrated, or that people might not be getting along.\n\n\n### Communication\n\nYou have to be an excellent communicator. There's no room for negotiation here. Be assertive, be clear, and be honest. \n\nBeing specific and confident in what you're saying about a task is critical. You can't rely on intention. People will do exactly as you say. Discover and minimize misunderstandings early. The same goes for your interactions with stakeholders; play your part and remove ambiguity when it appears.\n\nThis is a simple one but when messaging a team member about having a chat with them, give them a rough idea what it's about in advance.\n\n:::figure lessons-learned-leading-teams/graph.png A beautiful line graph showing that the \"importance of giving heads up\" is inversely proportional to \"frequency of contact\". Watch out for \"The 'OMG I'm getting fired' zone\" if contact is minimal.\n:::\n\nDisagreements aren't criticism. They're healthy as long as they don't block progression or damage relationships. Don't be mean, but say what you mean, early. Make sure everyone has a fair say. There's always a better way but what is the most feasible solution right now? Try to get agreement from everyone and ensure everyone understands the outcome.\n\nEncourage your team to challenge you, to tell you when you're wrong, but respectfully. The last thing you want is for them to be afraid to point out when you're wrong. Be your own harshest critic. Be honest when you don't know X and don't be afraid to admit you're learning. *Everyone is*.\n\nYou need to be serious and firm when giving criticism. If you're too lenient, it's harder to say something isn't acceptable later. The culture and standards of the team come from what you tolerate and promote.\n\n::: quote https://twitter.com/notch/status/1055887409035034624 Notch\nWe just need to stop letting people to trick us into thinking we actually CARE about the arguments we have over things we haven't researched. If we did, we'd research.\n:::\n\nDon't spend time debating that which doesn't warrant it. Once you have good people, trust that they've looked into what they're talking about, that they've looked at the details. Don't second guess the small stuff. When there's a disagreement over a decision, be honest about how much you care about the outcome. If it's 2/10 for you but 9/10 for them, let it go. This is related to having a personal attachment to details (\"perfectionism\") but I'll leave that for another post. \n\n\n### Represent and protect\n\nRepresent your team. Voice their concerns and share updates with them. Celebrate and recognise their hard work and achievements. Protect your team. Be an umbrella. Take negative criticism for them and only pass it down if they really need to hear it. Having anyone as a lead makes the team stronger, no matter who it is. Someone can stand up for the team and make things happen. Under promise, over deliver.\n\nYou now represent \"the man\". Understand top-down decisions; you need to in order to believe in them, and to then make others believe in them. Support your superiors. If they don't understand the challenges you're facing, that's your fault. Give them more situational awareness. Support them. Make them look good.\n\nManage stakeholder expectations as well as internal perspectives of your team and their work. Criticise team members if they're less than nice with other teams, for example. They're representing the team. Larger organisations can be tough as not everyone will respect the work being done by your team. Avoid pointing fingers or blaming other teams. I could benefit from being more savvy when it comes to politics but that's not what I'm about. You're all on the same side, act like it. When listing our values at [Teamwork](http://teamwork.com/), the following is often cited as a good example:\n\n::: quote\nLet the other person save face, even if they are clearly wrong\n:::\n\n\n### Process\n\nDon't go overboard on process. Start small, experiment, keep what works. Team members' past experiences and opinions will vary a lot. Make it clear that the process is evolving and can always be improved with a suggestion from a team member. Each team is different, you'll discover the best processes. Set as few rules as possible and strive for minimal viable bureaucracy or process.\n\n::: quote https://twitter.com/tastapod/status/1059384774131965952 Dan North \nYou shouldn’t start with the Spotify model. Spotify didn’t start with the Spotify model. You shouldn’t start with Scrum. Scrum didn’t start with Scrum. You should start by identifying what you want to improve, and introduce constraints that force the improvement.\n:::\n\nI'd recommend doing daily standups. They're really good when done properly. It should ideally be at the same time everyday, as early as possible. If everyone is in the same location, actually stand (otherwise people go on too long). If one person is remote, everyone should connect to the video call separately and ensure sound quality is good. If someone's late without notice / rescheduling it, start without them. Listen to each other, otherwise there isn't much point. People shouldn't go into too much detail or interject when others are talking. If a discussion needs to happen, finish the standup first, then anyone can stay for the discussion if they want. To sum up, keep it short and efficient.\n\nSchedule a regular chat with each person individually. Give them a chance to highlight successes or issues. This could be related to code, colleagues, your leadership, the company, home life, etc. Listen, empathise. Make sure you're up to speed on the work beforehand; it should be about them, not a status update for you. This is a good time to give feedback but keep it light. Try to give good with the bad. These conversations are really good; you'll be surprised by what comes up or how honest people will be. A lot of the time, the person will point out what they could improve on before you even get to it.\n\n\n### Probably the most difficult part of the job\n\nThe role is people oriented, and people problems are not trivial. Even the toughest bugs are a lot more straight-forward to solve than \"How can I keep this person happy?\" Keeping morale high has to be a focus and part of that is mixing the right people. Each individual person can differ in what drives them, in their skills, weaknesses, experiences, standards, and more. Getting great people in your team is key. Worries about how best to educate and manage fade away and you're left to figure out how best to delegate.\n\nYou will have opinionated team members and you'll have to drag words out of others. Developers tend to provide solutions and opinions rather than facts. This can lead to heated discussions. Monitor these. Get to a solution with healthy tension and without damaging relationships.\n\nYou also need to give people space to grow though. It's tempting to solve problems for people but you should step back and let people fail. Failure is part of the learning process. Notice when people are happy to stay in their comfort zone. Encourage them to improve their weak areas and clear their path. Make developers around you better. It's a sign of a great senior developer.\n\nPrepare to have to explain rationales for things. Don't get frustrated that people won't just do what you say. Explain. They'll learn from that. On the other hand, keep an eye out for people who have a problem with authority or taking over others' work / legacy code. There are times where all of us have to do something we don't like and people like this are less likely to improve their attitude in my experience.\n\n\n### A new technical mindset\n\nEven though the role is certainly people oriented, people come and go, what we build remains. You might be used to coming up with elegant solutions to clear problems as a developer, but you will now have to resolve hazy problems with far reaching solutions. Focus on the long term when it comes to a design decision. Is this solution advancing us towards our overall goals? Is it compatible with foreseeable future changes? You don't want to make a decision that makes it more difficult to make changes or add features later. Strongly consider long-term maintainability, architecture, deployment, stability, availability, scalability, and so on. Think about the whole ecosystem of apps, alignment, etc.\n\nIt's important to still be hands-on with code though. Some lessons can only be learned this way. Keep in touch, stay up to date, be respected. Identify patterns over time and keep an eye out for anyone implementing a pattern which'll come back to haunt us. Be careful when dropping the team lead role to play full-time developer on the other hand, other unnoticed issues might bubble up until they are too big to solve quickly.\n\nIn general, I'd promote test-driven development, as well as continuous integration, deployment, and delivery. Check out Steve Smith's [Measuring Continuous Delivery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afEzqDExCTE) talk if you haven't seen it. You should also measure app performance, feature usage, and so on. Don't go overboard but carefully select a few key metrics to begin with. \n\nLet the team influence code style. I absolutely hate arguments over code style, e.g. tabs vs spaces. Discuss as a team and agree, but keep it short. Document the outcome. It shouldn't be acceptable to argue about it in pull requests; code either matches the code style or not.

Look at what's coming down the line, find problems, solutions, prototype. Steer the technical direction based on these discoveries. This, like everything else, is a lot of easier once you have great team members which you trust.\n\n\n### Transition and expectations\n\nThe transition is not easy. It's a lonely role and your context will be unique. Even others in the same role in different teams in the organization will have different values and problems to solve. Relationships will change. There is a change of perspective from working alongside people to managing them while working alongside them.\n\nYou'll find yourself reframing conversations not to offend anyone, more than you'd like.

When revisiting advice a friend asked for when transitioning to a team lead position, I decided to flesh it out and put it online. Most of the following will hopefully be helpful to anyone leading a team or any manager, although some will be more relevant to leaders of developers and developers transitioning into leadership roles. If it helps anyone, great. It will be a good reference for me at least.

If someone can do something 80% as well as you or better, delegate! Focus on the stuff only you can do. Don\'t feel like you have to touch everything and be the best or most active person on the team. You\'re responsible for making sure everyone else does their best and grows.</p>\n<p>If you don\'t delegate enough, people feel like they\'re only doing the boring stuff and they\'ll feel undervalued as a result. They\'ll find somewhere they can have more impact and feel more valued. You\'ll be stressed because everyone is asking you to make a decision. Key decisions will stall as they wait for your call. The team will already have enough dependencies, which you\'re trying to resolve; don\'t become one.</p>\n<p>Always try to find more ways to delegate. Don\'t just give people work to do in small orchestrated pieces. It makes people more reliant on you. They learn less. Although it is hard when you know how to do it and they\'re still learning. Delegate decision making for a particular problem to the right person. People love autonomy. Try to ask yourself if the right people are looking at a problem so the best possible decision can be made. Show people how <em>they</em> can safely spread responsibilities and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Make yourself as redundant in the day-to-day work as possible. Ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, experience to get things done. You don\'t need to have the final say on everything and solve every hard problem. This gives you more time to work on the stuff only you can do.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, as you start to delegate more, you will become less familiar with the actual code and feel like more of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" rel="noopener">imposter</a>. Don\'t let this stop you from delegating though.</p>\n<h3><a id="efficiency" class="post-header-anchor" href="#efficiency" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Efficiency</h3>\n<p>Keep the team as efficient as possible. Protect them from distractions. For example, this also includes telling them about potential disruptive process changes being considered and meetings they\'d like to be in but really don\'t need to be.</p>\n<p>Emphasise knowledge sharing. Avoid someone fixing bugs related to X because they implemented X originally. Single points of failure are hard to avoid. People love to own their work. Taking responsibility is good but often leads to one person holding exclusive knowledge of something. Give someone territory and they\'ll likely become defensive.</p>\n<p>Unblock the team, address issues that are holding back the team or individuals; dependencies, external issues like blocking stakeholders, lack of knowledge, etc. Reduce friction. Always look for ways to make your team\'s life easier so they can do their best work. Shield them from company politics, pointless meetings, and other distractions. Resolve disagreements.</p>\n<p>Get the most out of different personalities. Understand what individuals need to perform optimally. Compromise, cultivate a team spirit. Promote continuous integration.</p>\n<p>Determine the type of lead you will be. Don\'t identify yourself or become a title / dependency. This will only limit team members. The title isn\'t an excuse to micro-manage. Don\'t read into the word &quot;lead&quot; too much. People shouldn\'t be at your mercy or at your beck and call. Focus on getting to a point where everyone can learn from each other and get their best possible work done.</p>\n<p>Keep an ear to the ground. Too much talk within the team might indicate a lack of productivity, decision making, or that they\'re enjoying themselves too much. If it\'s a bit too quiet, it might mean everyone is head down and there\'ll be problems once their code is integrated, or that people might not be getting along.</p>\n<h3><a id="communication" class="post-header-anchor" href="#communication" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Communication</h3>\n<p>You have to be an excellent communicator. There\'s no room for negotiation here. Be assertive, be clear, and be honest.</p>\n<p>Being specific and confident in what you\'re saying about a task is critical. You can\'t rely on intention. People will do exactly as you say. Discover and minimize misunderstandings early. The same goes for your interactions with stakeholders; play your part and remove ambiguity when it appears.</p>\n<p>This is a simple one but when messaging a team member about having a chat with them, give them a rough idea what it\'s about in advance.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/lessons-learned-leading-teams/graph.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/lessons-learned-leading-teams/graph.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A beautiful line graph showing that the &quot;importance of giving heads up&quot; is inversely proportional to &quot;frequency of contact&quot;. Watch out for &quot;The \'OMG I\'m getting fired\' zone&quot; if contact is minimal.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Disagreements aren\'t criticism. They\'re healthy as long as they don\'t block progression or damage relationships. Don\'t be mean, but say what you mean, early. Make sure everyone has a fair say. There\'s always a better way but what is the most feasible solution right now? Try to get agreement from everyone and ensure everyone understands the outcome.</p>\n<p>Encourage your team to challenge you, to tell you when you\'re wrong, but respectfully. The last thing you want is for them to be afraid to point out when you\'re wrong. Be your own harshest critic. Be honest when you don\'t know X and don\'t be afraid to admit you\'re learning. <em>Everyone is</em>.</p>\n<p>You need to be serious and firm when giving criticism. If you\'re too lenient, it\'s harder to say something isn\'t acceptable later. The culture and standards of the team come from what you tolerate and promote.</p>\n<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1055887409035034624 "><p>We just need to stop letting people to trick us into thinking we actually CARE about the arguments we have over things we haven\'t researched.

Once you have good people, trust that they\'ve looked into what they\'re talking about, that they\'ve looked at the details. Don\'t second guess the small stuff. When there\'s a disagreement over a decision, be honest about how much you care about the outcome. If it\'s 2/10 for you but 9/10 for them, let it go. This is related to having a personal attachment to details (&quot;perfectionism&quot;) but I\'ll leave that for another post.</p>\n<h3><a id="represent-and-protect" class="post-header-anchor" href="#represent-and-protect" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Represent and protect</h3>\n<p>Represent your team. Voice their concerns and share updates with them. Celebrate and recognise their hard work and achievements. Protect your team. Be an umbrella. Take negative criticism for them and only pass it down if they really need to hear it. Having anyone as a lead makes the team stronger, no matter who it is. Someone can stand up for the team and make things happen. Under promise, over deliver.</p>\n<p>You now represent &quot;the man&quot;. Understand top-down decisions; you need to in order to believe in them, and to then make others believe in them. Support your superiors. If they don\'t understand the challenges you\'re facing, that\'s your fault. Give them more situational awareness. Support them. Make them look good.</p>\n<p>Manage stakeholder expectations as well as internal perspectives of your team and their work. Criticise team members if they\'re less than nice with other teams, for example. They\'re representing the team. Larger organisations can be tough as not everyone will respect the work being done by your team. Avoid pointing fingers or blaming other teams. I could benefit from being more savvy when it comes to politics but that\'s not what I\'m about. You\'re all on the same side, act like it.

Start small, experiment, keep what works. Team members\' past experiences and opinions will vary a lot.

They\'re really good when done properly. It should ideally be at the same time everyday, as early as possible. If everyone is in the same location, actually stand (otherwise people go on too long). If one person is remote, everyone should connect to the video call separately and ensure sound quality is good. If someone\'s late without notice / rescheduling it, start without them. Listen to each other, otherwise there isn\'t much point. People shouldn\'t go into too much detail or interject when others are talking. If a discussion needs to happen, finish the standup first, then anyone can stay for the discussion if they want. To sum up, keep it short and efficient.</p>\n<p>Schedule a regular chat with each person individually. Give them a chance to highlight successes or issues. This could be related to code, colleagues, your leadership, the company, home life, etc. Listen, empathise. Make sure you\'re up to speed on the work beforehand; it should be about them, not a status update for you. This is a good time to give feedback but keep it light. Try to give good with the bad. These conversations are really good; you\'ll be surprised by what comes up or how honest people will be. A lot of the time, the person will point out what they could improve on before you even get to it.</p>\n<h3><a id="probably-the-most-difficult-part-of-the-job" class="post-header-anchor" href="#probably-the-most-difficult-part-of-the-job" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Probably the most difficult part of the job</h3>\n<p>The role is people oriented, and people problems are not trivial. Even the toughest bugs are a lot more straight-forward to solve than &quot;How can I keep this person happy?&quot; Keeping morale high has to be a focus and part of that is mixing the right people. Each individual person can differ in what drives them, in their skills, weaknesses, experiences, standards, and more. Getting great people in your team is key. Worries about how best to educate and manage fade away and you\'re left to figure out how best to delegate.</p>\n<p>You will have opinionated team members and you\'ll have to drag words out of others. Developers tend to provide solutions and opinions rather than facts. This can lead to heated discussions. Monitor these. Get to a solution with healthy tension and without damaging relationships.</p>\n<p>You also need to give people space to grow though. It\'s tempting to solve problems for people but you should step back and let people fail. Failure is part of the learning process. Notice when people are happy to stay in their comfort zone. Encourage them to improve their weak areas and clear their path. Make developers around you better. It\'s a sign of a great senior developer.</p>\n<p>Prepare to have to explain rationales for things. Don\'t get frustrated that people won\'t just do what you say. Explain. They\'ll learn from that. On the other hand, keep an eye out for people who have a problem with authority or taking over others\' work / legacy code. There are times where all of us have to do something we don\'t like and people like this are less likely to improve their attitude in my experience.</p>\n<h3><a id="a-new-technical-mindset" class="post-header-anchor" href="#a-new-technical-mindset" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>A new technical mindset</h3>\n<p>Even though the role is certainly people oriented, people come and go, what we build remains. You might be used to coming up with elegant solutions to clear problems as a developer, but you will now have to resolve hazy problems with far reaching solutions. Focus on the long term when it comes to a design decision. Is this solution advancing us towards our overall goals? Is it compatible with foreseeable future changes? You don\'t want to make a decision that makes it more difficult to make changes or add features later. Strongly consider long-term maintainability, architecture, deployment, stability, availability, scalability, and so on. Think about the whole ecosystem of apps, alignment, etc.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to still be hands-on with code though. Some lessons can only be learned this way. Keep in touch, stay up to date, be respected. Identify patterns over time and keep an eye out for anyone implementing a pattern which\'ll come back to haunt us. Be careful when dropping the team lead role to play full-time developer on the other hand, other unnoticed issues might bubble up until they are too big to solve quickly.</p>\n<p>In general, I\'d promote test-driven development, as well as continuous integration, deployment, and delivery. Check out Steve Smith\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afEzqDExCTE" rel="noopener">Measuring Continuous Delivery</a> talk if you haven\'t seen it. You should also measure app performance, feature usage, and so on. Don\'t go overboard but carefully select a few key metrics to begin with.</p>\n<p>Let the team influence code style. I absolutely hate arguments over code style, e.g. tabs vs spaces. Discuss as a team and agree, but keep it short. Document the outcome. It shouldn\'t be acceptable to argue about it in pull requests; code either matches the code style or not. Plan a separate time to discuss a change to the code style if needed. Where possible, use linting tools which automatically formats code as it\'s written or pre-commit, e.g. <a href="https://prettier.io/" rel="noopener">Prettier</a>.</p>\n<p>Monitor gaps in the team and knowledge, fill them. If a new developer joins the team with valuable insights or coding style,  re-align the team / integrate that.</p>\n<p>It\'s easy to get sucked into the current work and dragged into the weeds but try to stay ahead of the team. Look at what\'s coming down the line, find problems, solutions, prototype. Steer the technical direction based on these discoveries. This, like everything else, is a lot of easier once you have great team members which you trust.</p>\n<h3><a id="transition-and-expectations" class="post-header-anchor" href="#transition-and-expectations" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Transition and expectations</h3>\n<p>The transition is not easy. It\'s a lonely role and your context will be unique. Even others in the same role in different teams in the organization will have different values and problems to solve. Relationships will change. There is a change of perspective from working alongside people to managing them while working alongside them.</p>\n<p>You\'ll find yourself reframing conversations not to offend anyone, more than you\'d like. You need to bring positive energy even when you don\'t feel like it. Expect to have to give a lot of yourself, to facilitate, especially when the problem is unclear or complex. It\'s a bit lonelier. On the other hand, you get to see the whole picture. You get to step back and have more influence on the success of the company.</p>\n<p>Time management is difficult. There are a lot of interruptions and context-switching. Some of these interruptions will be from other teams; everyone else has priorities and everything needs to be done ASAP, but you have to think of your priorities. The person shouting the loudest shouldn\'t necessarily always get your attention first.</p>\n<p>Writing code and dealing with other issues is always going to clash. Deciding to be a tech lead means less coding, unless you work longer hours (but this isn\'t sustainable). There\'s less time to focus on a problem as a result and it\'s hard to measure your own performance. It\'s just not as tangible. As much as you\'d like to shut your door to focus, you must be accessible to your team. You might find yourself coming in early, staying late, or working on the weekend. This again ties into delegating and the imposter syndrome.</p>\n<h3><a id="what-do-i-know" class="post-header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-know" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>What do I know?</h3>\n<p>I\'m no expert and I don\'t get everything right.

If someone can do something 80% as well as you or better, delegate! Focus on the stuff only you can do. Don\'t feel like you have to touch everything and be the best or most active person on the team. You\'re responsible for making sure everyone else does their best and grows.</p>\n<p>If you don\'t delegate enough, people feel like they\'re only doing the boring stuff and they\'ll feel undervalued as a result. They\'ll find somewhere they can have more impact and feel more valued. You\'ll be stressed because everyone is asking you to make a decision. Key decisions will stall as they wait for your call. The team will already have enough dependencies, which you\'re trying to resolve; don\'t become one.</p>\n<p>Always try to find more ways to delegate. Don\'t just give people work to do in small orchestrated pieces. It makes people more reliant on you. They learn less. Although it is hard when you know how to do it and they\'re still learning. Delegate decision making for a particular problem to the right person. People love autonomy. Try to ask yourself if the right people are looking at a problem so the best possible decision can be made. Show people how <em>they</em> can safely spread responsibilities and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Make yourself as redundant in the day-to-day work as possible. Ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, experience to get things done. You don\'t need to have the final say on everything and solve every hard problem. This gives you more time to work on the stuff only you can do.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, as you start to delegate more, you will become less familiar with the actual code and feel like more of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" rel="noopener">imposter</a>. Don\'t let this stop you from delegating though.</p>\n<h3><a id="efficiency" class="post-header-anchor" href="#efficiency" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Efficiency</h3>\n<p>Keep the team as efficient as possible. Protect them from distractions. For example, this also includes telling them about potential disruptive process changes being considered and meetings they\'d like to be in but really don\'t need to be.</p>\n<p>Emphasise knowledge sharing. Avoid someone fixing bugs related to X because they implemented X originally. Single points of failure are hard to avoid. People love to own their work. Taking responsibility is good but often leads to one person holding exclusive knowledge of something. Give someone territory and they\'ll likely become defensive.</p>\n<p>Unblock the team, address issues that are holding back the team or individuals; dependencies, external issues like blocking stakeholders, lack of knowledge, etc. Reduce friction. Always look for ways to make your team\'s life easier so they can do their best work. Shield them from company politics, pointless meetings, and other distractions. Resolve disagreements.</p>\n<p>Get the most out of different personalities. Understand what individuals need to perform optimally. Compromise, cultivate a team spirit. Promote continuous integration.</p>\n<p>Determine the type of lead you will be. Don\'t identify yourself or become a title / dependency. This will only limit team members. The title isn\'t an excuse to micro-manage. Don\'t read into the word &quot;lead&quot; too much. People shouldn\'t be at your mercy or at your beck and call. Focus on getting to a point where everyone can learn from each other and get their best possible work done.</p>\n<p>Keep an ear to the ground. Too much talk within the team might indicate a lack of productivity, decision making, or that they\'re enjoying themselves too much. If it\'s a bit too quiet, it might mean everyone is head down and there\'ll be problems once their code is integrated, or that people might not be getting along.</p>\n<h3><a id="communication" class="post-header-anchor" href="#communication" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Communication</h3>\n<p>You have to be an excellent communicator.

This is related to having a personal attachment to details (&quot;perfectionism&quot;) but I\'ll leave that for another post.</p>\n<h3><a id="represent-and-protect" class="post-header-anchor" href="#represent-and-protect" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Represent and protect</h3>\n<p>Represent your team. Voice their concerns and share updates with them. Celebrate and recognise their hard work and achievements. Protect your team. Be an umbrella. Take negative criticism for them and only pass it down if they really need to hear it. Having anyone as a lead makes the team stronger, no matter who it is. Someone can stand up for the team and make things happen. Under promise, over deliver.</p>\n<p>You now represent &quot;the man&quot;. Understand top-down decisions; you need to in order to believe in them, and to then make others believe in them. Support your superiors. If they don\'t understand the challenges you\'re facing, that\'s your fault. Give them more situational awareness. Support them. Make them look good.</p>\n<p>Manage stakeholder expectations as well as internal perspectives of your team and their work. Criticise team members if they\'re less than nice with other teams, for example. They\'re representing the team. Larger organisations can be tough as not everyone will respect the work being done by your team. Avoid pointing fingers or blaming other teams. I could benefit from being more savvy when it comes to politics but that\'s not what I\'m about. You\'re all on the same side, act like it. When listing our values at <a href="http://teamwork.com/" rel="noopener">Teamwork</a>, the following is often cited as a good example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let the other person save face, even if they are clearly wrong</p>\n</blockquote><h3><a id="process" class="post-header-anchor" href="#process" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Process</h3>\n<p>Don\'t go overboard on process. Start small, experiment, keep what works. Team members\' past experiences and opinions will vary a lot. Make it clear that the process is evolving and can always be improved with a suggestion from a team member. Each team is different, you\'ll discover the best processes. Set as few rules as possible and strive for minimal viable bureaucracy or process.</p>\n<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/tastapod/status/1059384774131965952 "><p>You shouldn’t start with the Spotify model.

They\'re really good when done properly. It should ideally be at the same time everyday, as early as possible. If everyone is in the same location, actually stand (otherwise people go on too long). If one person is remote, everyone should connect to the video call separately and ensure sound quality is good. If someone\'s late without notice / rescheduling it, start without them. Listen to each other, otherwise there isn\'t much point. People shouldn\'t go into too much detail or interject when others are talking. If a discussion needs to happen, finish the standup first, then anyone can stay for the discussion if they want. To sum up, keep it short and efficient.</p>\n<p>Schedule a regular chat with each person individually. Give them a chance to highlight successes or issues. This could be related to code, colleagues, your leadership, the company, home life, etc. Listen, empathise. Make sure you\'re up to speed on the work beforehand; it should be about them, not a status update for you. This is a good time to give feedback but keep it light. Try to give good with the bad. These conversations are really good; you\'ll be surprised by what comes up or how honest people will be. A lot of the time, the person will point out what they could improve on before you even get to it.</p>\n<h3><a id="probably-the-most-difficult-part-of-the-job" class="post-header-anchor" href="#probably-the-most-difficult-part-of-the-job" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Probably the most difficult part of the job</h3>\n<p>The role is people oriented, and people problems are not trivial. Even the toughest bugs are a lot more straight-forward to solve than &quot;How can I keep this person happy?&quot; Keeping morale high has to be a focus and part of that is mixing the right people. Each individual person can differ in what drives them, in their skills, weaknesses, experiences, standards, and more. Getting great people in your team is key. Worries about how best to educate and manage fade away and you\'re left to figure out how best to delegate.</p>\n<p>You will have opinionated team members and you\'ll have to drag words out of others. Developers tend to provide solutions and opinions rather than facts. This can lead to heated discussions. Monitor these. Get to a solution with healthy tension and without damaging relationships.</p>\n<p>You also need to give people space to grow though. It\'s tempting to solve problems for people but you should step back and let people fail. Failure is part of the learning process. Notice when people are happy to stay in their comfort zone. Encourage them to improve their weak areas and clear their path. Make developers around you better. It\'s a sign of a great senior developer.</p>\n<p>Prepare to have to explain rationales for things. Don\'t get frustrated that people won\'t just do what you say. Explain. They\'ll learn from that. On the other hand, keep an eye out for people who have a problem with authority or taking over others\' work / legacy code. There are times where all of us have to do something we don\'t like and people like this are less likely to improve their attitude in my experience.</p>\n<h3><a id="a-new-technical-mindset" class="post-header-anchor" href="#a-new-technical-mindset" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>A new technical mindset</h3>\n<p>Even though the role is certainly people oriented, people come and go, what we build remains. You might be used to coming up with elegant solutions to clear problems as a developer, but you will now have to resolve hazy problems with far reaching solutions. Focus on the long term when it comes to a design decision. Is this solution advancing us towards our overall goals? Is it compatible with foreseeable future changes? You don\'t want to make a decision that makes it more difficult to make changes or add features later. Strongly consider long-term maintainability, architecture, deployment, stability, availability, scalability, and so on. Think about the whole ecosystem of apps, alignment, etc.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to still be hands-on with code though. Some lessons can only be learned this way. Keep in touch, stay up to date, be respected. Identify patterns over time and keep an eye out for anyone implementing a pattern which\'ll come back to haunt us. Be careful when dropping the team lead role to play full-time developer on the other hand, other unnoticed issues might bubble up until they are too big to solve quickly.</p>\n<p>In general, I\'d promote test-driven development, as well as continuous integration, deployment, and delivery. Check out Steve Smith\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afEzqDExCTE" rel="noopener">Measuring Continuous Delivery</a> talk if you haven\'t seen it. You should also measure app performance, feature usage, and so on. Don\'t go overboard but carefully select a few key metrics to begin with.</p>\n<p>Let the team influence code style. I absolutely hate arguments over code style, e.g. tabs vs spaces. Discuss as a team and agree, but keep it short. Document the outcome. It shouldn\'t be acceptable to argue about it in pull requests; code either matches the code style or not. Plan a separate time to discuss a change to the code style if needed. Where possible, use linting tools which automatically formats code as it\'s written or pre-commit, e.g. <a href="https://prettier.io/" rel="noopener">Prettier</a>.</p>\n<p>Monitor gaps in the team and knowledge, fill them. If a new developer joins the team with valuable insights or coding style,  re-align the team / integrate that.</p>\n<p>It\'s easy to get sucked into the current work and dragged into the weeds but try to stay ahead of the team. Look at what\'s coming down the line, find problems, solutions, prototype. Steer the technical direction based on these discoveries. This, like everything else, is a lot of easier once you have great team members which you trust.</p>\n<h3><a id="transition-and-expectations" class="post-header-anchor" href="#transition-and-expectations" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Transition and expectations</h3>\n<p>The transition is not easy. It\'s a lonely role and your context will be unique. Even others in the same role in different teams in the organization will have different values and problems to solve. Relationships will change. There is a change of perspective from working alongside people to managing them while working alongside them.</p>\n<p>You\'ll find yourself reframing conversations not to offend anyone, more than you\'d like. You need to bring positive energy even when you don\'t feel like it. Expect to have to give a lot of yourself, to facilitate, especially when the problem is unclear or complex. It\'s a bit lonelier. On the other hand, you get to see the whole picture. You get to step back and have more influence on the success of the company.</p>\n<p>Time management is difficult. There are a lot of interruptions and context-switching. Some of these interruptions will be from other teams; everyone else has priorities and everything needs to be done ASAP, but you have to think of your priorities. The person shouting the loudest shouldn\'t necessarily always get your attention first.</p>\n<p>Writing code and dealing with other issues is always going to clash. Deciding to be a tech lead means less coding, unless you work longer hours (but this isn\'t sustainable). There\'s less time to focus on a problem as a result and it\'s hard to measure your own performance. It\'s just not as tangible. As much as you\'d like to shut your door to focus, you must be accessible to your team. You might find yourself coming in early, staying late, or working on the weekend. This again ties into delegating and the imposter syndrome.</p>\n<h3><a id="what-do-i-know" class="post-header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-know" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>What do I know?</h3>\n<p>I\'m no expert and I don\'t get everything right.

One interesting piece of the [Teamwork CRM](https://www.teamwork.com/crm) puzzle was the "list view". \n\nIt\'s a powerful page component which exists seven times in the app — a table on steroids essentially. I could talk about it for days but I won\'t bore you. I\'ll focus on how we added a lot of flexibility with a few lines of CSS (Grid). Namely, how we lay out data-heavy tables, how we support resizing of columns, and more.\n\n:::\n\n\nFirst, I need to give some more context, starting with the purpose and design goals of these screens. Feel free to [skip to the CSS Grid bit](#just-get-to-css-grid-already).\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/wide3.png The leads list view.\n:::\n\nPrimarily it allows salespeople to scan a list of items like their leads or contacts, and find anything important they need to take action on. It\'s not like an Excel spreadsheet — we can do a better job at laying out the data, which there will be a lot of.\n\nEverything we do is responsively designed. We start with the most narrow / constrained variant first and tweak the layout based on content, design, use cases (we don\'t have device-orientated breakpoints). \n\nAt its most minimal, the columns are stacked vertically within rows, spanning the full width of the screen. \n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/narrow.png What a list view looks like on a narrow screen.\n:::\n\nResponsive tables are tricky. There are [several existing patterns](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html) you could pick from. Consider what your users are trying to achieve and choose wisely. \n\nOnce we have enough pixels in our canvas to play with, we switch to a more typical table layout such that the columns are... well, columns. There are no major layout changes beyond this point but we still want to display the columns as best as we can for the salesperson viewing it.\n\nAssume there are a lot of columns (we\'ll look at how the user can configure the columns in more detail later). The table should fill the width of the screen (at least). Column widths then should be determined by their content and the type of values they contain; e.g. short / long text, date, number, URL, etc. Date columns should take up less room than long text columns. \n\nColumns must have a minimum width and therefore only so many can fit into the viewport. As a result this table will be vertically and horizontally scrollable for a lot of salespeople.\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-window.gif How the layout varies per window width. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky, I provide some interactive examples below.\n:::\n\nTo begin with, we lay the table out as best we can using regular old-school table-layout CSS. Next, I\'ll show you how we enhance it with CSS Grid. Following that, how we leverage Grid to allow users to resize columns, which would be a lot more awkward with regular table-layout CSS.\n\n## Just get to CSS Grid already\n\nI\'m no CSS Grid expert but I love it. It\'s extremely powerful and simple, allowing you to implement previously tricky layouts with minute amounts of code. I\'ll skip giving an introduction to Grid in this article. Go read Rachel Andrew\'s [The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout) or [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and when you\'re done wondering where Grid was all your life, come back to me.\n\nThe first thing we do is apply `display: grid` to the `<table>` to make it a grid. This won\'t break anything if the browser doesn\'t support it (it will carry on using `display:table`). Its children become grid items; the `<thead>` and `<tbody>`. It\'s not the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, or even the `<tr>`s we\'re concerned with though. What we want to do is lay out our `<th>`s and `<td>`s on this grid. We could apply `display: grid` to each of these too (i.e. grids within grids), but that\'s not ideal. Each `<tr>` grid would be independent of others and that\'s not good (you\'ll see later that I had the same problem with Flexbox).\n\nA workaround is to use `display: contents` on the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tr>`s. This basically removes the them from the Grid layout, bypassing them, and promotes their children (the `<th>`s and `<td>`s) to participate in the the `<table>` grid instead. \n\nThen we use the magic `grid-template-columns` to control the grid items. Yes, one line of CSS. For example, if we had one date column and one URL column, it might be something like:\n\n```css\ngrid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) minmax(150px, 2.33fr);\n```\n\nWe use the same minimum size for all columns but the max (`fr`) value is determined by the column data type. I tried using Grid\'s`auto` and `max-content` too but what we\'ve ended up with seems to produce the best result.\n\nHere is a simplified example:\n\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="XwKWdG" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

Then try resizing the window.\n\n## Resizing columns with Grid\n\nOn top of this, we support reordering, resizing, and toggling which columns are shown. The lists of possible columns are long, including properties of the item (e.g. leads) itself, properties of related items (e.g. the company linked to the lead), and custom fields. \n\nFor example, a user could create a (date) custom field for contacts called "Date of birth" so that can be tracked in the system for each contact. \n\nSince a type like "Date" is selected when creating a custom field, our system already handles custom fields. There\'s more to think about when columns are toggled, but first I need to explain how resizing works.\n\n1. The user hovers over a column header, a resize handle is shown on the right hand side. We\'re listening for `mousedown` on the resize handle.\n2. When the user clicks the handle, we bind some more `mousemove` and `mousedown` event listeners (to the `window`). We also add some classes for decoration at this point.\n3. When the user moves their mouse, we calculate the new column width. This takes the cursor position, the table\'s scroll position, and our minimum into account. Then we re-set the `<table>`\'s `grid-template-columns`s rule (via `style` attribute), this time replacing the max (`fr`) value with a pixel value. For example, `grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) 296px;`. We do this using `requestAnimationFrame` to keep it as smooth as possible.\n4. When `mouseup` is fired, we unbind event listeners and remove classes.\n\nTry this simplified example (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/GaqgXP" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):\n\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="GaqgXP" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with good UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

It\'s a very precise action. Even if I wanted to resize a column using touch, I\'d probably expect a different interaction, like a multi-touch spread gesture.\n\n## Fixed column widths\n\nYou might have noticed I didn\'t tell the whole truth. Not only do we "fix" the width of the column you\'re resizing, we make all column widths fixed. Maybe you didn\'t even notice, because that\'s exactly how it should work.\n\nI originally thought that users would like that when they stretched or squeezed columns, the other ones could adjust too. If the columns filled the screen width nicely and you make one smaller, one (or some) of the others could grow if they had more content to show. Try this example for yourself below (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/wbWvep" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):\n\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="wbWvep" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with bad UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

As a user, I feel less in control when there are unpredictable side-effects to my actions. \n\nWe shouldn\'t make assumptions based on which column was or wasn\'t interacted with. When resizing one column, a user could have already made an implicit decision that the rest were perfect.\n\nTherefore, if you open the app for the first time, the columns are laid out as best as possible. If you resize your screen, they resize using the same ratios. Once you touch the resize handler of any column, all of the visible columns become fixed width.\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif Before, during, and after resizing a column. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky.\n:::\n\nOnce someone takes the time to tailor the screen to their needs, we take note. Any time a column is resized or made fixed, we create an independent localStorage entry mapping a column identifier to a pixel value.\n\nI can\'t remember exactly why we decided to set the fixed value using pixels, rather than something more fluid. Maybe it was just to keep it simple. Maybe it\'s because we do actually fall back to using a more archaic approach to setting column widths if Grid and `display: contents` aren\'t supported. You don\'t have to do this, it would have been too important to leave out for our users.\n\nUsing something fluid probably wouldn\'t align with the user\'s intentions anyway. We can\'t assume that making all columns smaller in order to keep more of them in the screen is the most important thing. If they had resized a column, it\'s to see a certain amount of content in that column. If we used a fluid unit, and then they made the screen narrower, we\'d be disregarding the choice they made. They\'d have to resize the column again to see the same content. Users are unlikely to be thinking "Hmm, I want this column to take up 20% of the window even if I resize it". Anyway, users rarely resize windows; I\'m going into too much detail on an edge case here.\n\n## Toggling columns\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png Our modal for customizing which columns are shown.\n:::\n\nImagine a salesperson has changed the column set using the above modal. If none of the chosen columns have been resized previously, they get laid out using the default `grid-template-column` values depending on their data type. For example, `minmax(150px, 3.33fr)`.\n\nIf any of the columns has a fixed width stored in localStorage, we make *all* of the chosen columns fixed width (and store those widths in localStorage too).\n\nOver time, more and more columns will become fixed. The only way for users to get back to fluid columns is if they were to reset the columns.\n\nWe also store an array of column identifiers in localStorage, separate to the column width entries.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use {{ libraryName }}?"\n\nI didn\'t want to just offload the problem to a heavy JavaScript library. It would be heavy, janky, wouldn\'t be responsive, and might not even use `<table>` at all. I also didn\'t want to write something like that myself. There must be a better way, I thought.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use Flexbox?"\n\nEach row would be evaluated / spaced independently of each other. A column might not be aligned with the column above it because of varying content length.\n\nI could have switched to `<div>`s representing the column containing the vertically stacked cells within. I didn\'t want to have to do this though. I wanted to use a `<table>`. On top of that, I could have easily ran into issues from the reverse angle anyway, like cells not matching in height across columns.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use a `<colgroup>`?"\n\nCheck out [`<colgroup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup), it\'s a handy old element. Once you define your columns using `<col>`s, styles applied to one will effectively be applied to all of the cells in that column. \n\nIn the end though, it was simply too limited for what I needed to do. It didn\'t take long to realise it was a no-go. So much so, that I can\'t remember exactly what the problems were. I\'m pretty sure it was impossible to achieve the level of fluidity I wanted, and it didn\'t work well with Flexbox or Grid.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use table-layout: fixed?"\n\nI could have use `table-layout: fixed` on the `<table>` and set the column widths using percentages. However, from looking at examples and playing around, this only seems to work if the table is 100% in width. Also resizing one column causes the other columns to resize to fill the 100% width.\n\n## "But you could still have used a table!"\n\nYes, tables can do a lot of smart things out of the box, but they can\'t efficiently support everything I wanted to do. Still disagree? OK you wizard, teach me.\n\n## Don\'t go overboard with display: contents\n\n`display:contents` allowed us to keep our table markup. Use it only when you really have to though. There is, or at least were, issues in some browsers around accessibility and how screen readers would read the content. \n\nWe discovered a [strange bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1550728) when combining it with native drag & drop in Firefox.\n\nFortunately, subgrid on the way which will properly allow descendants to participate in grids. Our use case is simple in that we want to effectively flatten the markup but subgrid will open the door for wilder multi-dimensional grid orgies. See [Why display: contents is not CSS Grid Layout subgrid](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/20/why-display-contents-is-not-css-grid-layout-subgrid/).\n\n## I\'m probably forgetting something\n\nThere\'s a lot more to this screen. I think there was some text-overflow issue when resizing columns but I can\'t remember anymore. \n\nWe use `position: sticky` to keep the table headers in place as you scroll down. It\'s a lovely enhancement and it degrades nicely. However, we do have a JavaScript fallback for IE11 users. I really wouldn\'t recommend doing that. It\'s tricky to achieve with horizontally scrollable tables.\n\nI didn\'t even touch on all of the features of these list views. Users can apply, save, and share custom filters (e.g. show me leads over $500 or where the contact is in Europe). These column filters can be set to remember the column set you had when you created them, because you might always want to see certain columns for a given workflow.\n\nWe\'ll soon support bulk editing via the list view, as well exporting your tailored view to CSV.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading.\n',unfilteredRenderedBody:'<h2><a id="flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid" class="post-header-anchor" href="#flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Flexible data tables with CSS Grid</h2>\n<article-summary><p>Now that we\'ve launched, I can finally talk about the secret project I\'ve been working on for the last two years.

It\'s extremely powerful and simple, allowing you to implement previously tricky layouts with minute amounts of code. I\'ll skip giving an introduction to Grid in this article. Go read Rachel Andrew\'s <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout" rel="noopener">The New CSS Layout</a> or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" rel="noopener">A Complete Guide to Grid</a> and when you\'re done wondering where Grid was all your life, come back to me.</p>\n<p>The first thing we do is apply <code>display: grid</code> to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> to make it a grid. This won\'t break anything if the browser doesn\'t support it (it will carry on using <code>display:table</code>). Its children become grid items; the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>. It\'s not the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, or even the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s we\'re concerned with though. What we want to do is lay out our <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s on this grid. We could apply <code>display: grid</code> to each of these too (i.e. grids within grids), but that\'s not ideal. Each <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> grid would be independent of others and that\'s not good (you\'ll see later that I had the same problem with Flexbox).</p>\n<p>A workaround is to use <code>display: contents</code> on the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s. This basically removes the them from the Grid layout, bypassing them, and promotes their children (the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s) to participate in the the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> grid instead.</p>\n<p>Then we use the magic <code>grid-template-columns</code> to control the grid items. Yes, one line of CSS. For example, if we had one date column and one URL column, it might be something like:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">grid-template-columns</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 1.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 2.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>We use the same minimum size for all columns but the max (<code>fr</code>) value is determined by the column data type. I tried using Grid\'s<code>auto</code> and <code>max-content</code> too but what we\'ve ended up with seems to produce the best result.</p>\n<p>Here is a simplified example:</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="XwKWdG" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

Not only do we &quot;fix&quot; the width of the column you\'re resizing, we make all column widths fixed. Maybe you didn\'t even notice, because that\'s exactly how it should work.</p>\n<p>I originally thought that users would like that when they stretched or squeezed columns, the other ones could adjust too. If the columns filled the screen width nicely and you make one smaller, one (or some) of the others could grow if they had more content to show. Try this example for yourself below (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/wbWvep" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="wbWvep" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with bad UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

As a user, I feel less in control when there are unpredictable side-effects to my actions.</p>\n<p>We shouldn\'t make assumptions based on which column was or wasn\'t interacted with. When resizing one column, a user could have already made an implicit decision that the rest were perfect.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you open the app for the first time, the columns are laid out as best as possible. If you resize your screen, they resize using the same ratios. Once you touch the resize handler of any column, all of the visible columns become fixed width.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Before, during, and after resizing a column. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Once someone takes the time to tailor the screen to their needs, we take note. Any time a column is resized or made fixed, we create an independent localStorage entry mapping a column identifier to a pixel value.</p>\n<p>I can\'t remember exactly why we decided to set the fixed value using pixels, rather than something more fluid. Maybe it was just to keep it simple. Maybe it\'s because we do actually fall back to using a more archaic approach to setting column widths if Grid and <code>display: contents</code> aren\'t supported. You don\'t have to do this, it would have been too important to leave out for our users.</p>\n<p>Using something fluid probably wouldn\'t align with the user\'s intentions anyway. We can\'t assume that making all columns smaller in order to keep more of them in the screen is the most important thing. If they had resized a column, it\'s to see a certain amount of content in that column. If we used a fluid unit, and then they made the screen narrower, we\'d be disregarding the choice they made. They\'d have to resize the column again to see the same content. Users are unlikely to be thinking &quot;Hmm, I want this column to take up 20% of the window even if I resize it&quot;. Anyway, users rarely resize windows; I\'m going into too much detail on an edge case here.</p>\n<h2><a id="toggling-columns" class="post-header-anchor" href="#toggling-columns" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Toggling columns</h2>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Our modal for customizing which columns are shown.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Imagine a salesperson has changed the column set using the above modal.

I think there was some text-overflow issue when resizing columns but I can\'t remember anymore.</p>\n<p>We use <code>position: sticky</code> to keep the table headers in place as you scroll down. It\'s a lovely enhancement and it degrades nicely. However, we do have a JavaScript fallback for IE11 users. I really wouldn\'t recommend doing that. It\'s tricky to achieve with horizontally scrollable tables.</p>\n<p>I didn\'t even touch on all of the features of these list views. Users can apply, save, and share custom filters (e.g. show me leads over $500 or where the contact is in Europe). These column filters can be set to remember the column set you had when you created them, because you might always want to see certain columns for a given workflow.</p>\n<p>We\'ll soon support bulk editing via the list view, as well exporting your tailored view to CSV.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for reading.</p>\n',attributes:{date:"2019-05-12T00:00:00.000Z",tags:[{id:"css-grid",name:"css grid"},{id:"css",name:"css"},{id:"javascript",name:"javascript"},{id:"table",name:"table"},{id:"data",name:"data"},{id:"responsive-design",name:"responsive design"},{id:"responsive",name:"responsive"},{id:"flexbox",name:"flexbox"},{id:"resize-column",name:"resize column"},{id:"web-app",name:"web app"},{id:"development",name:"development"},{id:"crm",name:"crm"},{id:"sales",name:"sales"}],title:"Flexible data tables with CSS Grid",updated_at:"2019-05-12T15:23:45.287Z",photo:"/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/wide3.png"},title:"Flexible data tables with CSS Grid",renderedSummary:"<p>Now that we've launched, I can finally talk about the secret project I've been working on for the last two years.

It\'s extremely powerful and simple, allowing you to implement previously tricky layouts with minute amounts of code. I\'ll skip giving an introduction to Grid in this article. Go read Rachel Andrew\'s <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout" rel="noopener">The New CSS Layout</a> or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" rel="noopener">A Complete Guide to Grid</a> and when you\'re done wondering where Grid was all your life, come back to me.</p>\n<p>The first thing we do is apply <code>display: grid</code> to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> to make it a grid. This won\'t break anything if the browser doesn\'t support it (it will carry on using <code>display:table</code>). Its children become grid items; the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>. It\'s not the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, or even the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s we\'re concerned with though. What we want to do is lay out our <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s on this grid. We could apply <code>display: grid</code> to each of these too (i.e. grids within grids), but that\'s not ideal. Each <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> grid would be independent of others and that\'s not good (you\'ll see later that I had the same problem with Flexbox).</p>\n<p>A workaround is to use <code>display: contents</code> on the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s. This basically removes the them from the Grid layout, bypassing them, and promotes their children (the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s) to participate in the the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> grid instead.</p>\n<p>Then we use the magic <code>grid-template-columns</code> to control the grid items. Yes, one line of CSS. For example, if we had one date column and one URL column, it might be something like:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">grid-template-columns</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 1.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 2.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>We use the same minimum size for all columns but the max (<code>fr</code>) value is determined by the column data type. I tried using Grid\'s<code>auto</code> and <code>max-content</code> too but what we\'ve ended up with seems to produce the best result.</p>\n<p>Here is a simplified example:</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="XwKWdG" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

The lists of possible columns are long, including properties of the item (e.g. leads) itself, properties of related items (e.g. the company linked to the lead), and custom fields.</p>\n<p>For example, a user could create a (date) custom field for contacts called &quot;Date of birth&quot; so that can be tracked in the system for each contact.</p>\n<p>Since a type like &quot;Date&quot; is selected when creating a custom field, our system already handles custom fields. There\'s more to think about when columns are toggled, but first I need to explain how resizing works.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user hovers over a column header, a resize handle is shown on the right hand side. We\'re listening for <code>mousedown</code> on the resize handle.</li>\n<li>When the user clicks the handle, we bind some more <code>mousemove</code> and <code>mousedown</code> event listeners (to the <code>window</code>). We also add some classes for decoration at this point.</li>\n<li>When the user moves their mouse, we calculate the new column width. This takes the cursor position, the table\'s scroll position, and our minimum into account. Then we re-set the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>\'s <code>grid-template-columns</code>s rule (via <code>style</code> attribute), this time replacing the max (<code>fr</code>) value with a pixel value. For example, <code>grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) 296px;</code>. We do this using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to keep it as smooth as possible.</li>\n<li>When <code>mouseup</code> is fired, we unbind event listeners and remove classes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Try this simplified example (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/GaqgXP" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="GaqgXP" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with good UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

Not only do we &quot;fix&quot; the width of the column you\'re resizing, we make all column widths fixed. Maybe you didn\'t even notice, because that\'s exactly how it should work.</p>\n<p>I originally thought that users would like that when they stretched or squeezed columns, the other ones could adjust too. If the columns filled the screen width nicely and you make one smaller, one (or some) of the others could grow if they had more content to show.

As a user, I feel less in control when there are unpredictable side-effects to my actions.</p>\n<p>We shouldn\'t make assumptions based on which column was or wasn\'t interacted with. When resizing one column, a user could have already made an implicit decision that the rest were perfect.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you open the app for the first time, the columns are laid out as best as possible. If you resize your screen, they resize using the same ratios. Once you touch the resize handler of any column, all of the visible columns become fixed width.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Before, during, and after resizing a column. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Once someone takes the time to tailor the screen to their needs, we take note. Any time a column is resized or made fixed, we create an independent localStorage entry mapping a column identifier to a pixel value.</p>\n<p>I can\'t remember exactly why we decided to set the fixed value using pixels, rather than something more fluid. Maybe it was just to keep it simple. Maybe it\'s because we do actually fall back to using a more archaic approach to setting column widths if Grid and <code>display: contents</code> aren\'t supported. You don\'t have to do this, it would have been too important to leave out for our users.</p>\n<p>Using something fluid probably wouldn\'t align with the user\'s intentions anyway. We can\'t assume that making all columns smaller in order to keep more of them in the screen is the most important thing. If they had resized a column, it\'s to see a certain amount of content in that column. If we used a fluid unit, and then they made the screen narrower, we\'d be disregarding the choice they made. They\'d have to resize the column again to see the same content. Users are unlikely to be thinking &quot;Hmm, I want this column to take up 20% of the window even if I resize it&quot;. Anyway, users rarely resize windows; I\'m going into too much detail on an edge case here.</p>\n<h2><a id="toggling-columns" class="post-header-anchor" href="#toggling-columns" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Toggling columns</h2>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Our modal for customizing which columns are shown.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Imagine a salesperson has changed the column set using the above modal.

There's a lot of flexibility, customization, and connected dots. Sometimes I daydream about working on an app which has one page, no settings, customization, or integrations, a single fixed viewport size to worry about, and so on. You know, an empty page.\n\nSeriously, I do love the challenge and I know it will make a lot of people happy. However, I do wonder how quickly I could make something simple from scratch. That's what this project is about.\n\n::: summary\n\nI love APIs. Especially open APIs. I wish there were way more of them. There's a lot of data out there we can't get our hands on. Imagine all of the unborn apps, studies, and infographics.\n\nThe natural conclusion was to create a Twitter bot. Have you ever seen Stefan Judis' [@randomMDN](https://twitter.com/randommdn)? It tweets a random article from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) multiple times a day. I decided to create one of my own to raise awareness about open APIs. Plus it's an excuse for a small fun project.\n\n:::\n\nI decided to time myself while I was at it. It took 42 minutes but read on, it wasn't all smooth sailing.\n\n#### Hello, world!\n\nI created a new directory with an `index.js` containing `console.log('Hello, world!)` and ran `node index` in the directory.\n\nOK, I managed not to mess that up. Then, I needed data about open APIs. Did you know people make curated lists of these APIs? Did you know there's... of course there's an API to get the list of APIs. Luckily, the [Public API for Public APIs](https://api.publicapis.org/) has a `/random` endpoint. At a glance it had enough information:\n\n- title (string)\n- description (string)\n- category (string)\n- And some other stuff (more about that later).\n\nLooks good. Now, I need to hit the API. I don't necessarily need to use a library but one library is better than two interfaces. I prefer a HTTP client library which supports both client and server-side usage. Axios is my latest library of choice for this. So I ran `npm init --yes && npm install axios` . Then I added the following code to `index.js`:\n\n```javascript\n  const axios = require('axios');\n  \n  axios.get('https://api.publicapis.org/random')\n  .then((response) => {\n    console.log(response.data);\n  })\n```\n\nNotice how little effort I'm putting into error handling. I'm on the clock.\n\nRunning `node index` resulted in:\n\n```javascripton\n{ count: 1,\n  entries:\n    [ { API: 'Livecoin',\n        Description: 'Cryptocurrency Exchange',\n        Auth: '',\n        HTTPS: true,\n        Cors: 'unknown',\n        Link: 'https://www.livecoin.net/api',\n        Category: 'Cryptocurrency' } ] }\n```\n\n### Writing the tweet\n\nNext, I constructed a tweet from the data. Luckily, none of the text is very long and Twitter doubled their tweet character limit to 280. I fiddled around way too long here. This is what I ended up with:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst camelCase = require('camelcase');\n\nconst formatHashtag = (text) => {\n  return camelCase(text.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, ''));\n};\n\naxios.get('https://api.publicapis.org/random')\n.then((response) => {\n  if(!response.data.entries.length){\n    throw new Error('No APIs found');\n  }\n\n  // Build tweet content\n  const api = response.data.entries[0];\n  const isDescriptionShort = api.Description.split(' ').length <= 2;\n  let tweet = `📡 Random Open API 📡\\n\\n${api.API}`; // .API is the name of the API\n\n  // If the description is too short, it's shown as a hashtag later instead\n  if(!isDescriptionShort){\n    tweet += `: ${api.Description} `;\n  }\n\n  tweet += `${api.Link} `;\n\n  const tags = ['openApi', 'api', formatHashtag(api.Category)];\n  if(isDescriptionShort){\n    tags.push(formatHashtag(api.Description));\n  }\n\n  tweet += tags.map(tag => `#${tag}`).join(' ');\n  console.log(tweet);\n})\n```\n\nI didn't like how it looked when the description was short (e.g. `Discogs: Music`). In this case, I used it as a hashtag instead.\n\n### Tweet, tweet!\n\nNext is actually sending a tweet. I did a quick google and ended up running `npm install twitter-lite` . I chose [twitter-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-lite) because:\n\n1. The documentation showed me what I needed to do at a glance.\n2. It didn't seem too heavy or outdated.\n3. It had `lite` in the name 🤷‍♂️.\n\nI needed the following Twitter credentials to post a tweet: \n\n- Consumer key.\n- Consumer secret.\n- Access token key.\n- Access token secret.\n\nThis is what took the longest in this project. I created the Twitter account, applied for access to [Twitter's APIs](https://developer.twitter.com/), created an app, and got the credentials I needed. I'm not going into too much detail here, it's tedious.\n\nI commented out the Axios call from before and threw in the following:\n\n```javascript\n// ...\nconst Twitter = require('twitter-lite');\n\nconst client = new Twitter({\n  subdomain: \"api\",\n  consumer_key: \"notTheRealValue\", // from Twitter.\n  consumer_secret: \"notTheRealValueEither\", // from Twitter.\n  access_token_key: \"nopeNotReal\", // from your User (oauth_token)\n  access_token_secret: \"hmmNoStillNotReal\" // from your User (oauth_token_secret)\n});\n\n// ....\n\nclient.post(\"statuses/update\", { status: 'Hello, World!' })\n.then(() => console.log('Success!'))\n```\n\nOnce I ran `node index` again, there was a `Hello, World!` tweet in my feed.\n\nNext, I combined the API and Twitter code, then ran it again;\n\n:::figure random-open-api/tweet.png A screenshot of the first Tweet posted (Daum maps).\n:::\n\nIsn't it beautiful?\n\n### Now, where to host this?\n\nI thought serverless would be a good fit for hosting this. I'd heard the praise Zeit's [Now](https://zeit.co/now) had gotten so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a serverless hosting platform which supports static files, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Go, and more. \n\nThey have integrations with GitHub and more but I went with the slightly more manual approach. I ran `npm install -g now && now login` and added a `now.json` file;\n\n```javascripton\n{\n  \"version\": 2,\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"*.js\", \"use\": \"@now/node\" }]\n}\n```\n\nThis tells Now that any JavaScript files should be built with their Node.js builder. \n\nI had to tweak my `index.js` slightly. First to add their function boilerplate, and secondly to call `res.end` to output something, rather than logging it to the console;\n\n```javascript\n// ...\n\nmodule.exports = (req, res) => { // Zeit boilerplate\n  axios.get('https://api.publicapis.org/random')\n  .then((response) => {\n    // ...\n    \n    // Tweet, tweet!\n    client.post(\"statuses/update\", { status: tweet })\n    .then(() => res.end('Success!'))\n    .catch((err) => {\n      res.end(`Error: ${err.message}\\n\\n${err.stack}`);\n    });\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    res.end(`Error: ${error.message}\\n\\n${error.stack}`);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nI then ran `now` which is their command for deploying your serverless function. This took a bit longer than I expected to be honest, but to be fair there's probably a lot going behind the scenes to achieve what Zeit provides. \n\nThe result:\n\n```shell\n> Deploying ~/Code/random-open-api under notmyreal@email.com\n> Using project random-open-api\n> https://random-open-api-jdhf89whf3489.now.sh [v2] [in clipboard] [3s]\n┌ index.js        Ready               [24s]\n└── λ index.js (39.83KB) [bru1]\n> Success! Deployment ready [28s]\n```\n\nNow gives you a new URL each time you deploy. I went to this URL in my browser and saw \"Success!\". Yes, it sent the tweet! That was easy.\n\n### Getting secretive\n\nI planned to open source the code and I didn't want to commit my Twitter credentials. First, I needed to create a secret for each so I ran the following commands:\n\n```shell\nnow secret add CONSUMER_KEY \"notTheRealValue\"\nnow secret add CONSUMER_SECRET \"notTheRealValueEither\"\nnow secret add ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY \"nopeNotReal\"\nnow secret add ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET \"hmmNoStillNotReal\"\n```\n\nThen I added the following `env` object to my `now.json` file. \n\n```javascripton\n{\n  \"version\": 2,\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"*.js\", \"use\": \"@now/node\" }],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"CONSUMER_KEY\": \"@consumer_key\",\n    \"CONSUMER_SECRET\": \"@consumer_secret\",\n    \"ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY\": \"@access_token_key\",\n    \"ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\": \"@access_token_secret\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis then allowed me to use `process.env.CONSUMER_KEY` in my function, for example;\n\n```javascript\nconst client = new Twitter({\n  subdomain: \"api\",\n  consumer_key: process.env.CONSUMER_KEY, // from Twitter.\n  consumer_secret: process.env.CONSUMER_SECRET, // from Twitter.\n  access_token_key: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, // from your User (oauth_token)\n  access_token_secret: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET // from your User (oauth_token_secret)\n});\n```\n\nNow would replace those references with the actual values when deploying. Not too complicated right?\n\nI ran `now` again but this time it didn't work. I got a blank response in my browser. Well, what happened was I somehow managed to type `process.key` , not `process.env` . I went down a rabbit hole trying all sorts of other ways of using environment variables, secrets, `now-env` , and more, before realizing my mistake.\n\n### Automation\n\nI was feeling good. All I had to do was configure Now to run the function on a schedule, publish the code, write and publish the blog post. Profit. \n\nWell, Zeit doesn't support running things on a schedule :(\n\nAt least they don't in Now version 2. I remember there was a bit of talk around the fact they released a backwards incompatible v2. It was forward thinking but had fewer features than v1. I think v1 supported what I needed but I didn't want to start a project by going back in time. \n\nThere were workarounds suggested in GitHub issues like having a `setInterval` in your function. Em, no. I swear, every time I play around with serverless, FaaS, or IoT, an obvious use case isn't covered.\n\nSo I gave up on Now. I decided to manually log into Twitter and tweet a few times a day...\n\nI actually settled for a simple but uncomfortable solution. It turns out there's a completely free (and open source) service, [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/), which will call your URL on a schedule.\n\n:::figure random-open-api/cron.png The job configuration.\n:::\n\nAll I had to do was sign up, create a job with my URL, and schedule it. As you see, I didn't even have to use the horrible [cron format](http://www.nncron.ru/help/EN/working/cron-format.htm). It was painless.\n\n### Deployment aliases\n\nI realized that if I ever deploy an update, I'll have to log into [cron-job.org](http://cron-job.org) and update the URL. Then I discovered Now's aliases. Individual deployments can be assigned deployments;\n\n:::figure random-open-api/alias.png The create alias modal.\n:::\n\nYou can choose a [now.sh](http://now.sh) subdomain or give your own domain.\n\nSo each time I update the code and deploy, I'll re-assign the alias to the new deployment. There's probably a better way around this but I didn't want to spend too long worrying about it. The code won't need to be updated much and if it ever does, I'd assume the Now dashboard is where it's managed.\n\n### The end\n\nSo that's it. It took me 42 minutes in total, including a couple of blunders. Thank you, bye. \n\nGoodbye!\n\nHey, stop, why are you still reading?\n\nUgh, fine...\n\n### Palm, have you met face?\n\nWhile writing this, I noticed that the API returns more than strictly \"open\" APIs. Some are, while others require some kind of signup and authentication. I guess I was trying to move too fast.\n\nLooking through results, even the ones which require authentication are still free and publicly available. It doesn't bother me then if they're not 100% \"open\", the data is still there to use.\n\nOh wait, no... they're not all free either. The [Semantria API](https://semantria.readme.io/docs) is one entry I just found for example; a \"paid Saas text analytics service\".\n\n![\"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!\" from the Godfather](/images/blog-content/random-open-api/godfather.gif)\n\nLooking at the Public API for Public APIs again, they also return an `auth` property for each API. I've seen results with `\"auth\": \"apiKey\"`, `\"auth\": \"OAuth\"`, and `\"auth\": \"\"`. I need to tweet about the last case.\n\nThe `/random` endpoint doesn't support filtering, so I'd have to keep calling it until I get one that's open. Hmm.\n\nThe `/entries` endpoint does support an `auth` filter parameter but it returns an array of APIs. This looks like my best bet. It doesn't support pagination so it must either return all or at least as many as it can. Here's the new API code:\n\n```javascript\naxios.get('https://api.publicapis.org/entries?auth=null')\n.then((response) => {\n  if(!response.data.entries.length){\n    throw new Error('No APIs found');\n  }\n\n  // Build tweet content from random result\n  const api = response.data.entries[Math.floor(Math.random() * response.data.entries.length)];\n```\n\nThere's no reason why `/random` couldn't also accept filter parameters. After I publish this, I'll go make a pull-request.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt was a nice break to rush head first into a small project, hacking something together without reading documentation, properly handling errors, etc. but I don't recommend working like this. It was almost a disaster.\n\nFollow [@randomOpenAPI](twitter.com/randomOpenAPI) on Twitter.

There\'s a lot of flexibility, customization, and connected dots. Sometimes I daydream about working on an app which has one page, no settings, customization, or integrations, a single fixed viewport size to worry about, and so on. You know, an empty page.</p>\n<p>Seriously, I do love the challenge and I know it will make a lot of people happy. However, I do wonder how quickly I could make something simple from scratch. That\'s what this project is about.</p>\n<article-summary><p>I love APIs. Especially open APIs. I wish there were way more of them. There\'s a lot of data out there we can\'t get our hands on. Imagine all of the unborn apps, studies, and infographics.</p>\n<p>The natural conclusion was to create a Twitter bot. Have you ever seen Stefan Judis\' <a href="https://twitter.com/randommdn" rel="noopener">@randomMDN</a>? It tweets a random article from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" rel="noopener">MDN</a> multiple times a day. I decided to create one of my own to raise awareness about open APIs. Plus it\'s an excuse for a small fun project.</p>\n</article-summary><p>I decided to time myself while I was at it.

Then, I needed data about open APIs. Did you know people make curated lists of these APIs? Did you know there\'s... of course there\'s an API to get the list of APIs. Luckily, the <a href="https://api.publicapis.org/" rel="noopener">Public API for Public APIs</a> has a <code>/random</code> endpoint.

Some are, while others require some kind of signup and authentication. I guess I was trying to move too fast.</p>\n<p>Looking through results, even the ones which require authentication are still free and publicly available. It doesn\'t bother me then if they\'re not 100% &quot;open&quot;, the data is still there to use.</p>\n<p>Oh wait, no... they\'re not all free either.

I\'ve seen results with <code>&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;apiKey&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;OAuth&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;&quot;</code>. I need to tweet about the last case.</p>\n<p>The <code>/random</code> endpoint doesn\'t support filtering, so I\'d have to keep calling it until I get one that\'s open. Hmm.</p>\n<p>The <code>/entries</code> endpoint does support an <code>auth</code> filter parameter but it returns an array of APIs. This looks like my best bet. It doesn\'t support pagination so it must either return all or at least as many as it can.

There\'s a lot of flexibility, customization, and connected dots. Sometimes I daydream about working on an app which has one page, no settings, customization, or integrations, a single fixed viewport size to worry about, and so on. You know, an empty page.</p>\n<p>Seriously, I do love the challenge and I know it will make a lot of people happy. However, I do wonder how quickly I could make something simple from scratch. That\'s what this project is about.</p>\n<p>I love APIs. Especially open APIs. I wish there were way more of them. There\'s a lot of data out there we can\'t get our hands on.

Then, I needed data about open APIs. Did you know people make curated lists of these APIs? Did you know there\'s... of course there\'s an API to get the list of APIs. Luckily, the <a href="https://api.publicapis.org/" rel="noopener">Public API for Public APIs</a> has a <code>/random</code> endpoint. At a glance it had enough information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>title (string)</li>\n<li>description (string)</li>\n<li>category (string)</li>\n<li>And some other stuff (more about that later).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looks good. Now, I need to hit the API. I don\'t necessarily need to use a library but one library is better than two interfaces. I prefer a HTTP client library which supports both client and server-side usage. Axios is my latest library of choice for this. So I ran <code>npm init --yes &amp;&amp; npm install axios</code> . Then I added the following code to <code>index.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">  <span class="token keyword">const</span> axios <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'axios\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  \n  axios<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">get</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'https://api.publicapis.org/random\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>response<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>response<span class="token punctuation">.</span>data<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how little effort I\'m putting into error handling.

Some are, while others require some kind of signup and authentication.

It doesn\'t bother me then if they\'re not 100% &quot;open&quot;, the data is still there to use.</p>\n<p>Oh wait, no... they\'re not all free either.

I\'ve seen results with <code>&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;apiKey&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;OAuth&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;auth&quot;: &quot;&quot;</code>. I need to tweet about the last case.</p>\n<p>The <code>/random</code> endpoint doesn\'t support filtering, so I\'d have to keep calling it until I get one that\'s open. Hmm.</p>\n<p>The <code>/entries</code> endpoint does support an <code>auth</code> filter parameter but it returns an array of APIs. This looks like my best bet. It doesn\'t support pagination so it must either return all or at least as many as it can.
