<p>"Welcome to Costco, can I have your phone number?" Most people would refuse, right? Well I suppose <em>some</em> might oblige, but that depends on a host of factors. This is what permissions requests are like on the web. Let's take a look at how we can do better, before it's too late. Side note: a phone number is like a SnapChat username to your parents.</p>
<p>We sure can build amazing experiences these days. We can leverage powerful browser APIs to access  users' location, send them notifications (whether your site is open or not), interact with MIDI devices, and a lot more. We didn't get here on our own though. A lot of these capabilities came to other platforms first. We are in our own league when it comes to UX and engagement however. Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.</p>

</figcaption>
        </figure><p>At the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It's understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I'd position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.</p>
<p>Examples aren't needed because we've all experienced it. It's not so bad if it's obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html" rel="noopener">Peter-Paul Koch argued</a> that the web shouldn't emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren't at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).</p>

<p>Well, the user's experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it's a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren't achieving what you set out to; users aren't accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.</p>

</figcaption>
        </figure><p>Chrome 63 (mobile) <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">adds fuel to the fire</a>. Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.</p>
<p>What will browsers do if we don't improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/" rel="noopener">removed the notification centre</a> citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.</p>

<p>Don't. Just don't. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you're playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you're asking right away because it's critical to your app, I'd re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you'd have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even <a href="https://webcamtests.com/" rel="noopener">https://webcamtests.com/</a> doesn't immediately ask for access to your webcam.</p>
<p>If you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they're immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask <em>when</em> you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they'd like to receive notifications of new articles after they'd read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user's browsers supports a feature, doesn't mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.</p>

<p>If you are going to interrupt the user (and that's what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance. You may only get one attempt. Clicking "Block" in Google Chrome is permanent, unless the user goes and manually overrides it for your site in Chrome's settings. Other browsers have a "Remember this choice" checkbox which results in the same thing.</p>

          <figcaption><p>Google Calendar's fake UI prompt for notifications</p>
</figcaption>
        </figure><p>This is where the double request pattern from mobile-land comes in. Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it's rejected or ignored, then fine. You're not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don't bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.</p>
<p>Requests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar's fake notification prompt is a good example.</p>
<p>You were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar's one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app's settings would be even better (although they're not mutually exclusively). Allowing the user to opt-in like that is surely the pattern with the highest success rate.</p>

<p>One problem with using fake UI is knowing whether or not the user has already granted the permission. You don't want to show the popup again on every visit and if it's an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; <code>Notification.permission</code> will either be <code>granted</code>, <code>denied</code>, or <code>prompt</code>. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven't got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/permissions/" rel="noopener">Permissions API</a> comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">navigator<span class="token punctuation">.</span>permissions<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">query</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> name<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'notifications'</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

	    <span class="token comment">// They've granted permission previously</span>

    <span class="token comment">/* 
     * The permission state cannot be checked. 
     * E.g. Firefox didn't support the persistent-storage permission name until Firefox 53
     */</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>For some APIs, permissions aren't as simple though so you can provide some context when querying;</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">navigator<span class="token punctuation">.</span>permissions<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">query</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> name<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'midi'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> sysex<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
  <span class="token comment">// ...</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the Permissions API is currently only supported in Chrome (43+) and Firefox (46+). When a permission is explicitly granted or denied, you can store that information in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" rel="noopener">localStorage</a> (or elsewhere) as a fallback. Then you can look up the permission's state there instead of querying it using the Permission API.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions" rel="noopener">Mozilla Developer Network</a> also describes similar methods for requesting and revoking permissions. No browser supports the former and the latter is only supported in Firefox (47+);</p>

<p>To encourage the user to opt-in, you could explain that they will be rewarded in some way. It's to you what that reward could be. Alternatively, you could just use gamification. For example, you could show an on-boarding checklist somewhere in your app, containing "Enable notifications" and anything else you'd like. Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications. Don't blackmail users though; don't block them from using certain features until they've granted a permission or signed up for your newsletter or anything like that.</p>

        </figure><p>We can do more than cross our fingers though. When the user interacts with your fake UI and you're about to trigger the native prompt, you could show something to guide them. It could even be an overlay which covers the entire page. By doing this, you can draw more attention to the prompt, prevent it being ignored, and even show some text. I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked. I'd keep this overlay simple though. You shouldn't assume where the native prompt will appear, browser-sniff, or have too much code here in general.</p>

<p>What you do once they enable the permission is another story. First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it's notifications they're granting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo" rel="noopener">don't go overboard</a>. There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications. My favourite part is that it defaults to sending you a notification for every message but once you've settled into app, it recommends reducing your notification level so you'll only get notified when you're @mentioned.</p>
<p>Don't send the user multiple notifications for the same thing. Even if I've your app is open in 20 tabs, I should only get one notification per event. The Notification API allows you to provide a "tag" to achieve this;</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Notification</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"New email from ..."</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> 
  body<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Hey, how are you? I was wondering..."</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

  <span class="token comment">// ...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If multiple notifications are created with the same tag (e.g. an email ID), the user will only receive one.</p>

<p>Help us out. Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done.</p>
<p>Maybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user's microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn't allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a "user gesture" such as a touch or click.</p>
<p>Chrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins" rel="noopener">like other features</a>), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn't in response to a user gesture. Can't we just enforce this for any permissions request?</p>
<p>Chrome's rules around accessing persistent-storage aren't as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)</li>
<li>The site has high site engagement</li>
<li>The site has been added to home screen</li>
<li>The site has push notifications enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, the permission is automatically denied.</p>
<p>I'm not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on <em>some</em> rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.</p>
<p>P.S. I noticed there's now a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog" rel="noopener">Dialog API</a>; it would be nice to add some rules here too before it gets too popular and people are using it to display ads the second you hit their page.</p>

</figcaption>
        </figure><p><a href="https://adamlynch.com/askblocker/" rel="noopener">AskBlocker</a> is an extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave, which keeps permissions requests in check. Permissions requests are blocked until you've interacted with the page (i.e. click, tap, or key press), with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the permission has been previously requested and granted (or explicitly denied).</li>
<li>If the domain is <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code>.</li>
<li>If you've navigated to the current page from another page on the same domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will at least block immediate requests to enable notifications the first time you go a site. You can see the requests which were caught and whitelist them (it will ask again and reload, to be safe). It's <a href="https://github.com/adam-lynch/askblocker" rel="noopener">open-source</a>.</p>
<p>Note: There aren't any extensions for other browsers (yet) because they don't support the Permissions API.</p>

Well I suppose *some* might oblige, but that depends on a host of factors. This is what permissions requests are like on the web. Let's take a look at how we can do better, before it's too late. Side note: a phone number is like a SnapChat username to your parents.\n\n:::\n\nWe sure can build amazing experiences these days. We can leverage powerful browser APIs to access  users' location, send them notifications (whether your site is open or not), interact with MIDI devices, and a lot more. We didn't get here on our own though. A lot of these capabilities came to other platforms first. We are in our own league when it comes to UX and engagement however. Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.\n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png Chris Wilson, [The New Bar for Web Experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ) (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)\n:::\n\nAt the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It's understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I'd position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.\n\nExamples aren't needed because we've all experienced it. It's not so bad if it's obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. [Peter-Paul Koch argued](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html) that the web shouldn't emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren't at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).\n\n\n### Why should I care?\n\nWell, the user's experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it's a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren't achieving what you set out to; users aren't accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.\n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg What the permissions prompt looks like in Chrome 63.\n:::\n\nChrome 63 (mobile) [adds fuel to the fire](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/). Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.\n\nWhat will browsers do if we don't improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already [removed the notification centre](https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/) citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.\n\n\n### When should I request access to these APIs?\n\nDon't. Just don't. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you're playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you're asking right away because it's critical to your app, I'd re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you'd have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even https://webcamtests.com/ doesn't immediately ask for access to your webcam.\n\nIf you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they're immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask *when* you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they'd like to receive notifications of new articles after they'd read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user's browsers supports a feature, doesn't mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.\n\n\n### The double request pattern\n\nIf you are going to interrupt the user (and that's what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance. You may only get one attempt. Clicking \"Block\" in Google Chrome is permanent, unless the user goes and manually overrides it for your site in Chrome's settings. Other browsers have a \"Remember this choice\" checkbox which results in the same thing.  \n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/google-calendar.png Google Calendar's fake UI prompt for notifications\n:::\n\nThis is where the double request pattern from mobile-land comes in. Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it's rejected or ignored, then fine. You're not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don't bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.\n\nRequests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar's fake notification prompt is a good example.\n\nYou were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar's one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app's settings would be even better (although they're not mutually exclusively). Allowing the user to opt-in like that is surely the pattern with the highest success rate.\n\n\n#### The permissions API\n\nOne problem with using fake UI is knowing whether or not the user has already granted the permission. You don't want to show the popup again on every visit and if it's an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; `Notification.permission` will either be `granted`, `denied`, or `prompt`. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven't got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.\n \nThe [Permissions API](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/) comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API. For example:\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' })\n  .then((result) -> {\n\t  if(result.status === 'granted'){\n\t    // They've granted permission previously\n\t  }\n\t  // Otherwise result.status is 'denied' or 'prompt'\n  })\n  .catch((error) -> {\n    /* \n     * The permission state cannot be checked. \n     * E.g. Firefox didn't support the persistent-storage permission name until Firefox 53\n     */\n  });\n```\n\nFor some APIs, permissions aren't as simple though so you can provide some context when querying;\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.permissions.query({ name: 'midi', sysex: true })\n  // ...\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the Permissions API is currently only supported in Chrome (43+) and Firefox (46+). When a permission is explicitly granted or denied, you can store that information in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) (or elsewhere) as a fallback. Then you can look up the permission's state there instead of querying it using the Permission API.\n\nThe [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions) also describes similar methods for requesting and revoking permissions. No browser supports the former and the latter is only supported in Firefox (47+);\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.permissions.revoke({ name: 'microphone' })\n  // ...\n```\n\n\n### Incentivize the user\n\nTo encourage the user to opt-in, you could explain that they will be rewarded in some way. It's to you what that reward could be. Alternatively, you could just use gamification. For example, you could show an on-boarding checklist somewhere in your app, containing \"Enable notifications\" and anything else you'd like. Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications. Don't blackmail users though; don't block them from using certain features until they've granted a permission or signed up for your newsletter or anything like that.\n\n\n### What if the native request is rejected?\n\nIt's unlikely but there is a chance the user could still reject access once the native prompt is shown (or ignore it). If this happens, you should show some feedback and explain how to manually enable the permission via their browser settings (or link to an explanation).\n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/whatsapp.png The overlay WhatsApp (web) shows when the native prompt is shown.\n:::\n\nWe can do more than cross our fingers though. When the user interacts with your fake UI and you're about to trigger the native prompt, you could show something to guide them. It could even be an overlay which covers the entire page. By doing this, you can draw more attention to the prompt, prevent it being ignored, and even show some text. I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked. I'd keep this overlay simple though. You shouldn't assume where the native prompt will appear, browser-sniff, or have too much code here in general.\n\n\n### Be reasonable\n\nWhat you do once they enable the permission is another story. First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it's notifications they're granting, [don't go overboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo). There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications. My favourite part is that it defaults to sending you a notification for every message but once you've settled into app, it recommends reducing your notification level so you'll only get notified when you're @mentioned.\n\nDon't send the user multiple notifications for the same thing. Even if I've your app is open in 20 tabs, I should only get one notification per event. The Notification API allows you to provide a \"tag\" to achieve this;\n\n```javascript\nnew Notification(\"New email from ...\", { \n  body: \"Hey, how are you? I was wondering...\",\n  tag: \"1\" \n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nIf multiple notifications are created with the same tag (e.g. an email ID), the user will only receive one.\n\n\n### Be pragmatic\n\nYou don't need to do *all* of this. It depends how important the permission in question is to your site. The web would be a better place if everyone applied even a little bit of this.\n\n::: quote Peter Drucker\nIf you can't measure it, you can't improve it.\n:::\n\nFor each permission or feature, track engagement and acceptance, how far users get before rejecting a permission, etc. This is a conversion funnel like any other. You can then tweak it and A/B test.\n\n\n### Dear browsers\n\nHelp us out. Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done. \n\nMaybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user's microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.\n\nNow let's take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn't allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a \"user gesture\" such as a touch or click. \n\nChrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins ([like other features](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins)), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn't in response to a user gesture. Can't we just enforce this for any permissions request?\n\nChrome's rules around accessing persistent-storage aren't as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:\n\n- The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)\n- The site has high site engagement\n- The site has been added to home screen\n- The site has push notifications enabled\n\nOtherwise, the permission is automatically denied. \n\nI'm not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on *some* rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.\n\nP.S. I noticed there's now a [Dialog API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog); it would be nice to add some rules here too before it gets too popular and people are using it to display ads the second you hit their page. \n\n\n### Introducing AskBlocker\n\nI've been thinking about writing this for a long time and it was Jason Grigsby's [Time to Update Your Permissions UX](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/) post that inspired me to actually do it. Not only did it turn out to be much longer than I expected, but I brought more work on myself by deciding to create browser extensions as well. \n\n:::figure improve-permissions-ux/askblocker.png AskBlocker for Chrome (screenshot)\n:::\n\n[AskBlocker](https://adamlynch.com/askblocker/) is an extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave, which keeps permissions requests in check. Permissions requests are blocked until you've interacted with the page (i.e. click, tap, or key press), with the following exceptions:\n\n- If the permission has been previously requested and granted (or explicitly denied).\n- If the domain is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.\n- If you've navigated to the current page from another page on the same domain.\n\nThis will at least block immediate requests to enable notifications the first time you go a site. You can see the requests which were caught and whitelist them (it will ask again and reload, to be safe). It's [open-source](https://github.com/adam-lynch/askblocker).\n\nNote: There aren't any extensions for other browsers (yet) because they don't support the Permissions API. \n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- We can learn lessons from mobile development and more.\n- Users aren't granting permissions requests.\n- It's no longer possible to dismiss requests in Google Chrome's mobile apps.\n- We looked at how to improve your permissions UX and increase acceptance rate; the keys are discipline, context, timing, measuring, and trust, among others.\n- Browsers, please help.\n- Try out [AskBlocker](https://adamlynch.com/askblocker).\n",unfilteredRenderedBody:'<h2><a id="how-to-improve-your-permissions-ux" class="post-header-anchor" href="#how-to-improve-your-permissions-ux" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>How to improve your permissions UX</h2>\n<article-summary><p>&quot;Welcome to Costco, can I have your phone number?&quot; Most people would refuse, right? Well I suppose <em>some</em> might oblige, but that depends on a host of factors. This is what permissions requests are like on the web. Let\'s take a look at how we can do better, before it\'s too late. Side note: a phone number is like a SnapChat username to your parents.</p>\n</article-summary><p>We sure can build amazing experiences these days. We can leverage powerful browser APIs to access  users\' location, send them notifications (whether your site is open or not), interact with MIDI devices, and a lot more. We didn\'t get here on our own though. A lot of these capabilities came to other platforms first. We are in our own league when it comes to UX and engagement however. Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Chris Wilson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ" rel="noopener">The New Bar for Web Experiences</a> (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>At the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It\'s understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I\'d position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.</p>\n<p>Examples aren\'t needed because we\'ve all experienced it. It\'s not so bad if it\'s obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html" rel="noopener">Peter-Paul Koch argued</a> that the web shouldn\'t emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren\'t at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).</p>\n<h3><a id="why-should-i-care" class="post-header-anchor" href="#why-should-i-care" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Why should I care?</h3>\n<p>Well, the user\'s experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it\'s a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren\'t achieving what you set out to; users aren\'t accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>What the permissions prompt looks like in Chrome 63.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Chrome 63 (mobile) <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">adds fuel to the fire</a>. Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.</p>\n<p>What will browsers do if we don\'t improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/" rel="noopener">removed the notification centre</a> citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.</p>\n<h3><a id="when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" class="post-header-anchor" href="#when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>When should I request access to these APIs?</h3>\n<p>Don\'t. Just don\'t. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you\'re playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you\'re asking right away because it\'s critical to your app, I\'d re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you\'d have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even <a href="https://webcamtests.com/" rel="noopener">https://webcamtests.com/</a> doesn\'t immediately ask for access to your webcam.</p>\n<p>If you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they\'re immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask <em>when</em> you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they\'d like to receive notifications of new articles after they\'d read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user\'s browsers supports a feature, doesn\'t mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-double-request-pattern" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-double-request-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The double request pattern</h3>\n<p>If you are going to interrupt the user (and that\'s what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance.

Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it\'s rejected or ignored, then fine. You\'re not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don\'t bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.</p>\n<p>Requests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar\'s fake notification prompt is a good example.</p>\n<p>You were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar\'s one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app\'s settings would be even better (although they\'re not mutually exclusively).

You don\'t want to show the popup again on every visit and if it\'s an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; <code>Notification.permission</code> will either be <code>granted</code>, <code>denied</code>, or <code>prompt</code>. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven\'t got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/permissions/" rel="noopener">Permissions API</a> comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API.

It\'s to you what that reward could be. Alternatively, you could just use gamification. For example, you could show an on-boarding checklist somewhere in your app, containing &quot;Enable notifications&quot; and anything else you\'d like. Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications.

I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked.

First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it\'s notifications they\'re granting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo" rel="noopener">don\'t go overboard</a>. There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications. My favourite part is that it defaults to sending you a notification for every message but once you\'ve settled into app, it recommends reducing your notification level so you\'ll only get notified when you\'re @mentioned.</p>\n<p>Don\'t send the user multiple notifications for the same thing.

Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done.</p>\n<p>Maybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user\'s microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.</p>\n<p>Now let\'s take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn\'t allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a &quot;user gesture&quot; such as a touch or click.</p>\n<p>Chrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins" rel="noopener">like other features</a>), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn\'t in response to a user gesture. Can\'t we just enforce this for any permissions request?</p>\n<p>Chrome\'s rules around accessing persistent-storage aren\'t as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)</li>\n<li>The site has high site engagement</li>\n<li>The site has been added to home screen</li>\n<li>The site has push notifications enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Otherwise, the permission is automatically denied.</p>\n<p>I\'m not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on <em>some</em> rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.</p>\n<p>P.S. I noticed there\'s now a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog" rel="noopener">Dialog API</a>; it would be nice to add some rules here too before it gets too popular and people are using it to display ads the second you hit their page.</p>\n<h3><a id="introducing-askblocker" class="post-header-anchor" href="#introducing-askblocker" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Introducing AskBlocker</h3>\n<p>I\'ve been thinking about writing this for a long time and it was Jason Grigsby\'s <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">Time to Update Your Permissions UX</a> post that inspired me to actually do it.

Most users see permissions requests (and these capabilities) as a nuisance.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/chris-wilson.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Chris Wilson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ" rel="noopener">The New Bar for Web Experiences</a> (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>At the last Chrome Dev Summit, Chris Wilson revealed that over 90% of permissions requests in Chrome for Android were unsuccessful. It\'s understandable. If there were an annoyance scale, I\'d position it somewhere between auto-playing media and when native mobile apps open a page from their own website in a WebView, which has a banner that tells you to install their mobile app.</p>\n<p>Examples aren\'t needed because we\'ve all experienced it. It\'s not so bad if it\'s obvious why the permission is needed, but in general, we need to try harder. <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html" rel="noopener">Peter-Paul Koch argued</a> that the web shouldn\'t emulate native (apps) because it will lead to bad UX. Was he right? These APIs aren\'t at fault but our implementations are sloppy. As web developers and designers we should lift our heads up and look around a bit more; we can learn a lot from mobile (and other platforms).</p>\n<h3><a id="why-should-i-care" class="post-header-anchor" href="#why-should-i-care" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Why should I care?</h3>\n<p>Well, the user\'s experience should be of utmost importance in general, but in particular, it\'s a bad first impression to immediately ask someone for their location. A permissions request is an easy way to disrupt the user and it instantly makes your site less trustworthy. From content credibility to conversions, trust plays a key role on the web. Simplest of all, you aren\'t achieving what you set out to; users aren\'t accepting permissions requests. In fact, it could be hurting you more than it helps. For example, you might want to send people notifications to reduce churn and keep them coming back to your content. However, it could be driving people away before they even read a single article.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/balls.jpg" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>What the permissions prompt looks like in Chrome 63.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Chrome 63 (mobile) <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/time-to-update-your-permissions-ux/" rel="noopener">adds fuel to the fire</a>. Requests appear like modals in front of the content and users no longer have the option to dismiss the request without making a decision. This will also reduce the amount of repeat requests as users can no longer dismiss. This will surely spur sites to improve their UX. Users will not put up with sites triggering a modal like that on top of HTML modals, banners and annoying ads covering the page on load.</p>\n<p>What will browsers do if we don\'t improve? They might disable access to these APIs by default. Users would then have to grant the permission from their browser settings. If browsers feel like being nice they might show a little icon somewhere (e.g. in the address bar) which would show the prompt on click. Disabling by default would be extreme but Google already <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-improves-its-ai-face-and-image-recognition-tools/" rel="noopener">removed the notification centre</a> citing lack of usage and it would certainly make a lot of users happy.</p>\n<h3><a id="when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" class="post-header-anchor" href="#when-should-i-request-access-to-these-apis" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>When should I request access to these APIs?</h3>\n<p>Don\'t. Just don\'t. Only ask for access if you really need it. If you\'re playing around on your personal site or making an API demo, fine, but if you have users, have empathy. You are not your users. If you\'re asking right away because it\'s critical to your app, I\'d re-think that. Will your site or app really not function without it? I doubt it. Otherwise, you\'d have to block people from using your app who respond negatively to the permissions request then? Even <a href="https://webcamtests.com/" rel="noopener">https://webcamtests.com/</a> doesn\'t immediately ask for access to your webcam.</p>\n<p>If you actually need access, context is key. It starts at the door. Make sure the user understands what your site or app is about. How can they if they\'re immediately presented with a request to track their location? Provide some value to the user first if you can, build some trust. Only ask <em>when</em> you really need to. Wait until they get to your store locator before you even begin to think about asking for their location. Ask the user if they\'d like to receive notifications of new articles after they\'d read a couple. People often think of progressive enhancement as a stack. Just because the user\'s browsers supports a feature, doesn\'t mean you should use it right away. There is something to be said for nailing the core experience and enhancing it over time, you know, progressively.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-double-request-pattern" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-double-request-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The double request pattern</h3>\n<p>If you are going to interrupt the user (and that\'s what it is, an interruption), then at least do your best to increase the chances of acceptance. You may only get one attempt. Clicking &quot;Block&quot; in Google Chrome is permanent, unless the user goes and manually overrides it for your site in Chrome\'s settings. Other browsers have a &quot;Remember this choice&quot; checkbox which results in the same thing.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/google-calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/improve-permissions-ux/google-calendar.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Google Calendar\'s fake UI prompt for notifications</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>This is where the double request pattern from mobile-land comes in. Show some fake UI first, i.e. HTML. If the user responds positively, then trigger the native permissions request. If it\'s rejected or ignored, then fine. You\'re not limited to one attempt and can ask them again whenever you want. Be smart here though, don\'t bombard the user. Ask again after a few more visits or come up with a clever algorithm.</p>\n<p>Requests without context are granted 40% less (another fact Chris Wilson shared in his talk). When showing this fake prompt, explain why the permission is needed, how the user will benefit, what will happen once they accept (the native request prompt will appear), etc. If you want to send notifications, what will the notifications be about? How often will the user receive them? The new Google Calendar\'s fake notification prompt is a good example.</p>\n<p>You were probably imagining a popup (like Google Calendar\'s one) so far, but hiding the option away in your app\'s settings would be even better (although they\'re not mutually exclusively). Allowing the user to opt-in like that is surely the pattern with the highest success rate.</p>\n<h4><a id="the-permissions-api" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-permissions-api" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The permissions API</h4>\n<p>One problem with using fake UI is knowing whether or not the user has already granted the permission. You don\'t want to show the popup again on every visit and if it\'s an app setting, it should look enabled. Some of the APIs provide a way to figure this out. Notifications for example; <code>Notification.permission</code> will either be <code>granted</code>, <code>denied</code>, or <code>prompt</code>. This varies from API to API and some APIs haven\'t got an option like that at all. For example, the geolocation API; there is no way to check if the user has previously granted access to their location without requesting it again.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/permissions/" rel="noopener">Permissions API</a> comes in handy here. It allows us to query the status of any permission through a single (asynchronous) interface, even the geolocation API. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">navigator<span class="token punctuation">.</span>permissions<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">query</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> name<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'notifications\'</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>result<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t  <span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>result<span class="token punctuation">.</span>status <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">\'granted\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t    <span class="token comment">// They\'ve granted permission previously</span>\n\t  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n\t  <span class="token comment">// Otherwise result.status is \'denied\' or \'prompt\'</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token comment">/* \n     * The permission state cannot be checked. \n     * E.g.

Simply showing the number of completed items or completion percentage to the user will be enough to get some to enable notifications.

I remember when Google Chrome first got popular, some sites would show an arrow pointing at the download bar after you downloaded something. It was crude but it worked.

First of all, you should ideally give users the option to opt-out. Especially if it\'s notifications they\'re granting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkND9G_VqVo" rel="noopener">don\'t go overboard</a>. There is no spam filter for notifications. You could provide further settings to tweak how permissions are used. For example, Slack provides granular settings around notifications.

Changes could be made to improve the experience for users and prevent abuse. To be fair, browsers block requesting a permission after three dismissals (i.e. when the user ignores it). Google Chrome (at least) allows requests again after a week. This is good but more could be done.</p>\n<p>Maybe browsers could allow us to provide some text (a new API option) that will be shown within the native prompt to give more context to the user. This might make a request to access the user\'s microphone feel a bit less creepy. Alternatively, if we pass a callback, the prompt could have an icon, link, or button to learn why the permission is being requested.</p>\n<p>Now let\'s take a look at some measures that already exist to prevent abuse. As a security feature, the Bluetooth API doesn\'t allow you to request a device unless it was triggered by a &quot;user gesture&quot; such as a touch or click.</p>\n<p>Chrome (at least) no longer allows notifications from iFrames, from insecure origins (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins" rel="noopener">like other features</a>), and even warns you if you request notifications and it wasn\'t in response to a user gesture. Can\'t we just enforce this for any permissions request?</p>\n<p>Chrome\'s rules around accessing persistent-storage aren\'t as simple; Chrome will automatically grant the persistence permission if any of the following are true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The site is bookmarked (and the user has 5 or less bookmarks)</li>\n<li>The site has high site engagement</li>\n<li>The site has been added to home screen</li>\n<li>The site has push notifications enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Otherwise, the permission is automatically denied.</p>\n<p>I\'m not saying those rules are good or bad but browsers should agree on <em>some</em> rules to enforce in respect to all permissions requests. That is my plea. Of course, developers and designers need to do better regardless, but this would really help.</p>\n<p>P.S.

One interesting piece of the [Teamwork CRM](https://www.teamwork.com/crm) puzzle was the "list view". \n\nIt\'s a powerful page component which exists seven times in the app — a table on steroids essentially. I could talk about it for days but I won\'t bore you. I\'ll focus on how we added a lot of flexibility with a few lines of CSS (Grid). Namely, how we lay out data-heavy tables, how we support resizing of columns, and more.\n\n:::\n\n\nFirst, I need to give some more context, starting with the purpose and design goals of these screens. Feel free to [skip to the CSS Grid bit](#just-get-to-css-grid-already).\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/wide3.png The leads list view.\n:::\n\nPrimarily it allows salespeople to scan a list of items like their leads or contacts, and find anything important they need to take action on. It\'s not like an Excel spreadsheet — we can do a better job at laying out the data, which there will be a lot of.\n\nEverything we do is responsively designed. We start with the most narrow / constrained variant first and tweak the layout based on content, design, use cases (we don\'t have device-orientated breakpoints). \n\nAt its most minimal, the columns are stacked vertically within rows, spanning the full width of the screen. \n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/narrow.png What a list view looks like on a narrow screen.\n:::\n\nResponsive tables are tricky. There are [several existing patterns](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html) you could pick from. Consider what your users are trying to achieve and choose wisely. \n\nOnce we have enough pixels in our canvas to play with, we switch to a more typical table layout such that the columns are... well, columns. There are no major layout changes beyond this point but we still want to display the columns as best as we can for the salesperson viewing it.\n\nAssume there are a lot of columns (we\'ll look at how the user can configure the columns in more detail later). The table should fill the width of the screen (at least). Column widths then should be determined by their content and the type of values they contain; e.g. short / long text, date, number, URL, etc. Date columns should take up less room than long text columns. \n\nColumns must have a minimum width and therefore only so many can fit into the viewport. As a result this table will be vertically and horizontally scrollable for a lot of salespeople.\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-window.gif How the layout varies per window width. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky, I provide some interactive examples below.\n:::\n\nTo begin with, we lay the table out as best we can using regular old-school table-layout CSS. Next, I\'ll show you how we enhance it with CSS Grid. Following that, how we leverage Grid to allow users to resize columns, which would be a lot more awkward with regular table-layout CSS.\n\n## Just get to CSS Grid already\n\nI\'m no CSS Grid expert but I love it. It\'s extremely powerful and simple, allowing you to implement previously tricky layouts with minute amounts of code. I\'ll skip giving an introduction to Grid in this article. Go read Rachel Andrew\'s [The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout) or [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and when you\'re done wondering where Grid was all your life, come back to me.\n\nThe first thing we do is apply `display: grid` to the `<table>` to make it a grid. This won\'t break anything if the browser doesn\'t support it (it will carry on using `display:table`). Its children become grid items; the `<thead>` and `<tbody>`. It\'s not the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, or even the `<tr>`s we\'re concerned with though. What we want to do is lay out our `<th>`s and `<td>`s on this grid. We could apply `display: grid` to each of these too (i.e. grids within grids), but that\'s not ideal. Each `<tr>` grid would be independent of others and that\'s not good (you\'ll see later that I had the same problem with Flexbox).\n\nA workaround is to use `display: contents` on the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tr>`s. This basically removes the them from the Grid layout, bypassing them, and promotes their children (the `<th>`s and `<td>`s) to participate in the the `<table>` grid instead. \n\nThen we use the magic `grid-template-columns` to control the grid items. Yes, one line of CSS. For example, if we had one date column and one URL column, it might be something like:\n\n```css\ngrid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) minmax(150px, 2.33fr);\n```\n\nWe use the same minimum size for all columns but the max (`fr`) value is determined by the column data type. I tried using Grid\'s`auto` and `max-content` too but what we\'ve ended up with seems to produce the best result.\n\nHere is a simplified example:\n\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="XwKWdG" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid">\n  <span>Something went wrong. View <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/XwKWdG/" target="_blank">\n  Flexible data table with CSS Grid</a> by Adam Lynch (<a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch">@adam-lynch</a>)\n  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"><\/script>\n\nYou should <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/debug/XwKWdG" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a> as it\'s a bit constrained embedded here like this. Then try resizing the window.\n\n## Resizing columns with Grid\n\nOn top of this, we support reordering, resizing, and toggling which columns are shown. The lists of possible columns are long, including properties of the item (e.g. leads) itself, properties of related items (e.g. the company linked to the lead), and custom fields. \n\nFor example, a user could create a (date) custom field for contacts called "Date of birth" so that can be tracked in the system for each contact. \n\nSince a type like "Date" is selected when creating a custom field, our system already handles custom fields. There\'s more to think about when columns are toggled, but first I need to explain how resizing works.\n\n1. The user hovers over a column header, a resize handle is shown on the right hand side. We\'re listening for `mousedown` on the resize handle.\n2. When the user clicks the handle, we bind some more `mousemove` and `mousedown` event listeners (to the `window`). We also add some classes for decoration at this point.\n3. When the user moves their mouse, we calculate the new column width. This takes the cursor position, the table\'s scroll position, and our minimum into account. Then we re-set the `<table>`\'s `grid-template-columns`s rule (via `style` attribute), this time replacing the max (`fr`) value with a pixel value. For example, `grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) 296px;`. We do this using `requestAnimationFrame` to keep it as smooth as possible.\n4. When `mouseup` is fired, we unbind event listeners and remove classes.\n\nTry this simplified example (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/GaqgXP" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):\n\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="GaqgXP" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with good UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

It\'s a very precise action. Even if I wanted to resize a column using touch, I\'d probably expect a different interaction, like a multi-touch spread gesture.\n\n## Fixed column widths\n\nYou might have noticed I didn\'t tell the whole truth. Not only do we "fix" the width of the column you\'re resizing, we make all column widths fixed. Maybe you didn\'t even notice, because that\'s exactly how it should work.\n\nI originally thought that users would like that when they stretched or squeezed columns, the other ones could adjust too. If the columns filled the screen width nicely and you make one smaller, one (or some) of the others could grow if they had more content to show. Try this example for yourself below (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/wbWvep" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):\n\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="wbWvep" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with bad UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

As a user, I feel less in control when there are unpredictable side-effects to my actions. \n\nWe shouldn\'t make assumptions based on which column was or wasn\'t interacted with. When resizing one column, a user could have already made an implicit decision that the rest were perfect.\n\nTherefore, if you open the app for the first time, the columns are laid out as best as possible. If you resize your screen, they resize using the same ratios. Once you touch the resize handler of any column, all of the visible columns become fixed width.\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif Before, during, and after resizing a column. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky.\n:::\n\nOnce someone takes the time to tailor the screen to their needs, we take note. Any time a column is resized or made fixed, we create an independent localStorage entry mapping a column identifier to a pixel value.\n\nI can\'t remember exactly why we decided to set the fixed value using pixels, rather than something more fluid. Maybe it was just to keep it simple. Maybe it\'s because we do actually fall back to using a more archaic approach to setting column widths if Grid and `display: contents` aren\'t supported. You don\'t have to do this, it would have been too important to leave out for our users.\n\nUsing something fluid probably wouldn\'t align with the user\'s intentions anyway. We can\'t assume that making all columns smaller in order to keep more of them in the screen is the most important thing. If they had resized a column, it\'s to see a certain amount of content in that column. If we used a fluid unit, and then they made the screen narrower, we\'d be disregarding the choice they made. They\'d have to resize the column again to see the same content. Users are unlikely to be thinking "Hmm, I want this column to take up 20% of the window even if I resize it". Anyway, users rarely resize windows; I\'m going into too much detail on an edge case here.\n\n## Toggling columns\n\n:::figure flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png Our modal for customizing which columns are shown.\n:::\n\nImagine a salesperson has changed the column set using the above modal. If none of the chosen columns have been resized previously, they get laid out using the default `grid-template-column` values depending on their data type. For example, `minmax(150px, 3.33fr)`.\n\nIf any of the columns has a fixed width stored in localStorage, we make *all* of the chosen columns fixed width (and store those widths in localStorage too).\n\nOver time, more and more columns will become fixed. The only way for users to get back to fluid columns is if they were to reset the columns.\n\nWe also store an array of column identifiers in localStorage, separate to the column width entries.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use {{ libraryName }}?"\n\nI didn\'t want to just offload the problem to a heavy JavaScript library. It would be heavy, janky, wouldn\'t be responsive, and might not even use `<table>` at all. I also didn\'t want to write something like that myself. There must be a better way, I thought.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use Flexbox?"\n\nEach row would be evaluated / spaced independently of each other. A column might not be aligned with the column above it because of varying content length.\n\nI could have switched to `<div>`s representing the column containing the vertically stacked cells within. I didn\'t want to have to do this though. I wanted to use a `<table>`. On top of that, I could have easily ran into issues from the reverse angle anyway, like cells not matching in height across columns.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use a `<colgroup>`?"\n\nCheck out [`<colgroup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup), it\'s a handy old element. Once you define your columns using `<col>`s, styles applied to one will effectively be applied to all of the cells in that column. \n\nIn the end though, it was simply too limited for what I needed to do. It didn\'t take long to realise it was a no-go. So much so, that I can\'t remember exactly what the problems were. I\'m pretty sure it was impossible to achieve the level of fluidity I wanted, and it didn\'t work well with Flexbox or Grid.\n\n## "Why didn\'t you just use table-layout: fixed?"\n\nI could have use `table-layout: fixed` on the `<table>` and set the column widths using percentages. However, from looking at examples and playing around, this only seems to work if the table is 100% in width. Also resizing one column causes the other columns to resize to fill the 100% width.\n\n## "But you could still have used a table!"\n\nYes, tables can do a lot of smart things out of the box, but they can\'t efficiently support everything I wanted to do. Still disagree? OK you wizard, teach me.\n\n## Don\'t go overboard with display: contents\n\n`display:contents` allowed us to keep our table markup. Use it only when you really have to though. There is, or at least were, issues in some browsers around accessibility and how screen readers would read the content. \n\nWe discovered a [strange bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1550728) when combining it with native drag & drop in Firefox.\n\nFortunately, subgrid on the way which will properly allow descendants to participate in grids. Our use case is simple in that we want to effectively flatten the markup but subgrid will open the door for wilder multi-dimensional grid orgies. See [Why display: contents is not CSS Grid Layout subgrid](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/20/why-display-contents-is-not-css-grid-layout-subgrid/).\n\n## I\'m probably forgetting something\n\nThere\'s a lot more to this screen. I think there was some text-overflow issue when resizing columns but I can\'t remember anymore. \n\nWe use `position: sticky` to keep the table headers in place as you scroll down. It\'s a lovely enhancement and it degrades nicely. However, we do have a JavaScript fallback for IE11 users. I really wouldn\'t recommend doing that. It\'s tricky to achieve with horizontally scrollable tables.\n\nI didn\'t even touch on all of the features of these list views. Users can apply, save, and share custom filters (e.g. show me leads over $500 or where the contact is in Europe). These column filters can be set to remember the column set you had when you created them, because you might always want to see certain columns for a given workflow.\n\nWe\'ll soon support bulk editing via the list view, as well exporting your tailored view to CSV.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading.\n',unfilteredRenderedBody:'<h2><a id="flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid" class="post-header-anchor" href="#flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Flexible data tables with CSS Grid</h2>\n<article-summary><p>Now that we\'ve launched, I can finally talk about the secret project I\'ve been working on for the last two years.

It\'s extremely powerful and simple, allowing you to implement previously tricky layouts with minute amounts of code. I\'ll skip giving an introduction to Grid in this article. Go read Rachel Andrew\'s <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout" rel="noopener">The New CSS Layout</a> or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" rel="noopener">A Complete Guide to Grid</a> and when you\'re done wondering where Grid was all your life, come back to me.</p>\n<p>The first thing we do is apply <code>display: grid</code> to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> to make it a grid. This won\'t break anything if the browser doesn\'t support it (it will carry on using <code>display:table</code>). Its children become grid items; the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>. It\'s not the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, or even the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s we\'re concerned with though. What we want to do is lay out our <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s on this grid. We could apply <code>display: grid</code> to each of these too (i.e. grids within grids), but that\'s not ideal. Each <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> grid would be independent of others and that\'s not good (you\'ll see later that I had the same problem with Flexbox).</p>\n<p>A workaround is to use <code>display: contents</code> on the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s. This basically removes the them from the Grid layout, bypassing them, and promotes their children (the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s) to participate in the the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> grid instead.</p>\n<p>Then we use the magic <code>grid-template-columns</code> to control the grid items. Yes, one line of CSS. For example, if we had one date column and one URL column, it might be something like:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">grid-template-columns</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 1.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 2.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>We use the same minimum size for all columns but the max (<code>fr</code>) value is determined by the column data type. I tried using Grid\'s<code>auto</code> and <code>max-content</code> too but what we\'ve ended up with seems to produce the best result.</p>\n<p>Here is a simplified example:</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="XwKWdG" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

The lists of possible columns are long, including properties of the item (e.g. leads) itself, properties of related items (e.g. the company linked to the lead), and custom fields.</p>\n<p>For example, a user could create a (date) custom field for contacts called &quot;Date of birth&quot; so that can be tracked in the system for each contact.</p>\n<p>Since a type like &quot;Date&quot; is selected when creating a custom field, our system already handles custom fields. There\'s more to think about when columns are toggled, but first I need to explain how resizing works.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user hovers over a column header, a resize handle is shown on the right hand side. We\'re listening for <code>mousedown</code> on the resize handle.</li>\n<li>When the user clicks the handle, we bind some more <code>mousemove</code> and <code>mousedown</code> event listeners (to the <code>window</code>). We also add some classes for decoration at this point.</li>\n<li>When the user moves their mouse, we calculate the new column width. This takes the cursor position, the table\'s scroll position, and our minimum into account. Then we re-set the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>\'s <code>grid-template-columns</code>s rule (via <code>style</code> attribute), this time replacing the max (<code>fr</code>) value with a pixel value. For example, <code>grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) 296px;</code>. We do this using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to keep it as smooth as possible.</li>\n<li>When <code>mouseup</code> is fired, we unbind event listeners and remove classes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Try this simplified example (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/GaqgXP" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="GaqgXP" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with good UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

Not only do we &quot;fix&quot; the width of the column you\'re resizing, we make all column widths fixed. Maybe you didn\'t even notice, because that\'s exactly how it should work.</p>\n<p>I originally thought that users would like that when they stretched or squeezed columns, the other ones could adjust too. If the columns filled the screen width nicely and you make one smaller, one (or some) of the others could grow if they had more content to show. Try this example for yourself below (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/wbWvep" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="wbWvep" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with bad UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

As a user, I feel less in control when there are unpredictable side-effects to my actions.</p>\n<p>We shouldn\'t make assumptions based on which column was or wasn\'t interacted with. When resizing one column, a user could have already made an implicit decision that the rest were perfect.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you open the app for the first time, the columns are laid out as best as possible. If you resize your screen, they resize using the same ratios. Once you touch the resize handler of any column, all of the visible columns become fixed width.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Before, during, and after resizing a column. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Once someone takes the time to tailor the screen to their needs, we take note. Any time a column is resized or made fixed, we create an independent localStorage entry mapping a column identifier to a pixel value.</p>\n<p>I can\'t remember exactly why we decided to set the fixed value using pixels, rather than something more fluid. Maybe it was just to keep it simple. Maybe it\'s because we do actually fall back to using a more archaic approach to setting column widths if Grid and <code>display: contents</code> aren\'t supported. You don\'t have to do this, it would have been too important to leave out for our users.</p>\n<p>Using something fluid probably wouldn\'t align with the user\'s intentions anyway. We can\'t assume that making all columns smaller in order to keep more of them in the screen is the most important thing. If they had resized a column, it\'s to see a certain amount of content in that column. If we used a fluid unit, and then they made the screen narrower, we\'d be disregarding the choice they made. They\'d have to resize the column again to see the same content. Users are unlikely to be thinking &quot;Hmm, I want this column to take up 20% of the window even if I resize it&quot;. Anyway, users rarely resize windows; I\'m going into too much detail on an edge case here.</p>\n<h2><a id="toggling-columns" class="post-header-anchor" href="#toggling-columns" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Toggling columns</h2>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Our modal for customizing which columns are shown.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Imagine a salesperson has changed the column set using the above modal.

It\'s extremely powerful and simple, allowing you to implement previously tricky layouts with minute amounts of code. I\'ll skip giving an introduction to Grid in this article. Go read Rachel Andrew\'s <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout" rel="noopener">The New CSS Layout</a> or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" rel="noopener">A Complete Guide to Grid</a> and when you\'re done wondering where Grid was all your life, come back to me.</p>\n<p>The first thing we do is apply <code>display: grid</code> to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> to make it a grid. This won\'t break anything if the browser doesn\'t support it (it will carry on using <code>display:table</code>). Its children become grid items; the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>. It\'s not the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, or even the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s we\'re concerned with though. What we want to do is lay out our <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s on this grid. We could apply <code>display: grid</code> to each of these too (i.e. grids within grids), but that\'s not ideal. Each <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> grid would be independent of others and that\'s not good (you\'ll see later that I had the same problem with Flexbox).</p>\n<p>A workaround is to use <code>display: contents</code> on the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s. This basically removes the them from the Grid layout, bypassing them, and promotes their children (the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s) to participate in the the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> grid instead.</p>\n<p>Then we use the magic <code>grid-template-columns</code> to control the grid items. Yes, one line of CSS. For example, if we had one date column and one URL column, it might be something like:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">grid-template-columns</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 1.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">minmax</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>150px, 2.33fr<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>We use the same minimum size for all columns but the max (<code>fr</code>) value is determined by the column data type. I tried using Grid\'s<code>auto</code> and <code>max-content</code> too but what we\'ve ended up with seems to produce the best result.</p>\n<p>Here is a simplified example:</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="XwKWdG" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

The lists of possible columns are long, including properties of the item (e.g. leads) itself, properties of related items (e.g. the company linked to the lead), and custom fields.</p>\n<p>For example, a user could create a (date) custom field for contacts called &quot;Date of birth&quot; so that can be tracked in the system for each contact.</p>\n<p>Since a type like &quot;Date&quot; is selected when creating a custom field, our system already handles custom fields. There\'s more to think about when columns are toggled, but first I need to explain how resizing works.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user hovers over a column header, a resize handle is shown on the right hand side. We\'re listening for <code>mousedown</code> on the resize handle.</li>\n<li>When the user clicks the handle, we bind some more <code>mousemove</code> and <code>mousedown</code> event listeners (to the <code>window</code>). We also add some classes for decoration at this point.</li>\n<li>When the user moves their mouse, we calculate the new column width. This takes the cursor position, the table\'s scroll position, and our minimum into account. Then we re-set the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>\'s <code>grid-template-columns</code>s rule (via <code>style</code> attribute), this time replacing the max (<code>fr</code>) value with a pixel value. For example, <code>grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1.33fr) 296px;</code>. We do this using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to keep it as smooth as possible.</li>\n<li>When <code>mouseup</code> is fired, we unbind event listeners and remove classes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Try this simplified example (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/GaqgXP" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="GaqgXP" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with good UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

Not only do we &quot;fix&quot; the width of the column you\'re resizing, we make all column widths fixed. Maybe you didn\'t even notice, because that\'s exactly how it should work.</p>\n<p>I originally thought that users would like that when they stretched or squeezed columns, the other ones could adjust too. If the columns filled the screen width nicely and you make one smaller, one (or some) of the others could grow if they had more content to show. Try this example for yourself below (or ideally <a href="https://codepen.io/adam-lynch/pen/wbWvep" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a>):</p>\n<p class="codepen" data-height="390" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="adam-lynch" data-slug-hash="wbWvep" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Flexible data table with CSS Grid (resizable columns with bad UX)">\n  <span>Something went wrong.

As a user, I feel less in control when there are unpredictable side-effects to my actions.</p>\n<p>We shouldn\'t make assumptions based on which column was or wasn\'t interacted with. When resizing one column, a user could have already made an implicit decision that the rest were perfect.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you open the app for the first time, the columns are laid out as best as possible. If you resize your screen, they resize using the same ratios. Once you touch the resize handler of any column, all of the visible columns become fixed width.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/resizing-columns.gif" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Before, during, and after resizing a column. Sorry the GIF is a bit janky.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Once someone takes the time to tailor the screen to their needs, we take note. Any time a column is resized or made fixed, we create an independent localStorage entry mapping a column identifier to a pixel value.</p>\n<p>I can\'t remember exactly why we decided to set the fixed value using pixels, rather than something more fluid. Maybe it was just to keep it simple. Maybe it\'s because we do actually fall back to using a more archaic approach to setting column widths if Grid and <code>display: contents</code> aren\'t supported. You don\'t have to do this, it would have been too important to leave out for our users.</p>\n<p>Using something fluid probably wouldn\'t align with the user\'s intentions anyway. We can\'t assume that making all columns smaller in order to keep more of them in the screen is the most important thing. If they had resized a column, it\'s to see a certain amount of content in that column. If we used a fluid unit, and then they made the screen narrower, we\'d be disregarding the choice they made. They\'d have to resize the column again to see the same content. Users are unlikely to be thinking &quot;Hmm, I want this column to take up 20% of the window even if I resize it&quot;. Anyway, users rarely resize windows; I\'m going into too much detail on an edge case here.</p>\n<h2><a id="toggling-columns" class="post-header-anchor" href="#toggling-columns" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Toggling columns</h2>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/manage-columns.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>Our modal for customizing which columns are shown.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Imagine a salesperson has changed the column set using the above modal.

Since then, we’ve added a few nice features, fixed some bugs, and introduced a couple. You know how it goes. More and more companies are using our app, including some really famous ones. At the time of writing this, over 12 million messages have been sent. Teamwork has grown three times in size, and the Teamwork Chat team with it, thanks to some great hires.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of my predictions from last year’s post;\n\n> As NW.js (0.12.0) is basically Chrome (41), we can just put our desktop app on the Web and it will basically just work. That’s a simplification but you get the picture.\n\nAlong with our Windows and Mac OS X desktop apps, [Teamwork Chat](https://www.teamwork.com/chat) is now available in your favourite Web browser. This was almost as easy as we expected. See [Donal’s](http://engineroom.teamwork.com/author/donal/) recent [Deploying the Teamwork Chat Web app](http://engineroom.teamwork.com/how-we-sped-up-serving-static-files-in-teamwork-chat/) post for more.\n\nSure, Teamwork Chat is a mobile-first responsive app, so yes, users could access Teamwork Chat on their phones. This was welcomed with open arms, but did I make any mobile *app* predictions?\n\n> Even further, we should be able to create Android and iOS apps by sticking our app in a WebView. We’re attempting to build a consistent experience across all platforms from the one codebase. It’s not as easy as I make out though; expect more posts to follow up on this.\n\nYep, and that’s what we’ve done. In this post, I’m going to describe how our [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamwork.chat&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teamwork-chat/id978062035?mt=8) apps came to be, lessons we’ve learned along the way, and where we’re headed. Not only in respect to mobile apps, but Teamwork Chat as a whole.\n\n### Mobile apps, finally\n\nWe released our first internal prototype about a year ago; a mash of Appcelerator and some Web code. It wasn’t as nice as we thought it would be. We would’ve needed to put in a lot more work to make it really usable. We had bigger fish to fry though. After a painful period of trying to maintain it while delivering key features, it was put to one side. We eventually got back to it, starting again from scratch.\n\nOf course, we wanted Android and iOS apps which allowed you to do everything you could already do in Teamwork Chat. Push notifications and being able to share a file to the app were minimum requirements as well. Unlike other apps where you could get away without those, they’re critical for any chat app. We imagined that the least the Teamwork Chat mobile apps could do is allow you to contact someone while on the go and stay in the loop, as well as quickly share a photo you’ve just taken, for example.\n\nOur intention, as much now as it was then, is to have a consistent and familiar experience across all of our apps. Someone should be easily able to start a conversation on one device and carry it on elsewhere.\n\n### Reusing our Web app\n\nBy this stage, users were crying out for mobile apps. Our plan was to get mobile apps out there and improve on them. We planned to reuse our Web app and see how far we could get. We took ownership of (most of) the app as apposed to our mobile team here at Teamwork. We got a lot of the way for free as we had already fought to maintain (mobile-first) reponsiveness and touch-friendliness throughout. We got an iPad app for free due to the fact our app is responsive. Note: we’ve never used device-orientated breakpoints in our designs.\n\nNow, mobile apps are also considered in every feature from the beginning. Reusing code between our Web, desktop, and mobile apps enables us to fix a bug once and it’s fixed everywhere. As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac & Windows desktop apps, our Android & iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.\n\nIt was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t *responsible*. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.\n\n:::figure under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png A navigation menu we tweaked.\n:::\n\nWe forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.\n\n### Native wrappers\n\nEnough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.\n\nThe native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.\n\nNotifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.\n\nYou can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.\n\n### But what about *real* mobile apps?\n\nOK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.\n\nA lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.\n\nWe put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.\n\n### Sharing\n\n:::figure under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.\n:::\n\nAndroid and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.\n\nOnce the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.\n\nThese days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.\n\n### Feature parity\n\nThis is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.\n\nThis certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.\n\nYes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.\n\nIn order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.\n\nThis comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.\n\nI wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.\n\nTo make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?\n\n### Living with a mobile app\n\nWorking on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.\n\nEven though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.\n\nBy changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.\n\nThis is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) to [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.\n\n### Feature flags\n\nWe’ve been talking about using [proper feature flags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY) for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.\n\nTeamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.\n\n### The release\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExpecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first. The terrible piece of software that is iTunes Connect gives you the option to release the app immediately once it has been validated, on or past a certain date, as well as a manual release. We opted for a manual release. The plan was that was once we were alerted that the app was ready, we’d submit the Android app, and once that was out, we’d hit the publish button. Note: the Google Play Developer Console (which is awful too) has added a manual release option since then.\n\nOur iOS app was rejected. Argh! We had marketing campaigns ongoing teasing something big, we had to quickly come up with a plan B. We didn’t want to be empty handed when the end of the month came by. Why did it fail? Basically, there was a misunderstanding in what our app was, and who it was targeted at. We promptly submitted an appeal, and even though we knew we were right, we were amazed to see the decision overturned a couple of days later. The Android release took a couple of hours, and that was it, the Teamwork Chat mobile apps were out there. We were ecstatic.\n\n### The future\n\nThere is definitely room for improvement, I’ll be the first to say it. They could be faster, start up quicker, be less janky, and so on. We’re going to work hard on this. The great thing is that this these efforts will translate into improvements in the Web and desktop apps as well.\n\nWe will be making native mobile apps. We have planned to for awhile now. We have some mobile developers in-house dying for a crack at it. Expect a couple of great apps that really feel at home in your OS. One upside to going down the native route is that users can see you care as you’ve tailored an app to their OS. Sure they’ll be distinct, the Android one will have a strong material design feel, but we’ll strive to keep in sync with each other and Teamwork Chat in general when it comes to features as well as the overall experience.\n\nSure, this means we’ll have fewer eyes on our Web app on a mobile Web browser or narrow screen, but it’s worth it.\n\n### Automation and deployment\n\nRight now, our desktop apps need to built on Windows for Windows and on Mac for Mac. This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly dploy.io) to [CodeShip](https://codeship.com/) for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.\n\nAll of our services are now deployed once we push to `master`. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.\n\nThere are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain `[skip-resp-tests]` exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.\n\n### Lessons learned\n\nWe haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off [Teamwork Projects](https://teamwork.com/projects). Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ [**cluster**](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.\n\nAs I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via `cluster` or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.\n\nHow our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general. We’re going to switch over to RabbitMQ from Redis, re-do a lot of the messaging, and try to remove the dependency on a shared database at the same time.\n\n### Fire in the hole\n\nAs well as improving areas we’ve neglected, these are some of the bigger higher level features we have coming down the line:\n\n-  API\n-  Bots (prepared third-party bots and a bot API/platform)\n-  Conversation switcher\n-  Deeper integrations with [Teamwork Desk](https://teamwork.com/desk) and [Teamwork Projects](https://teamwork.com/projects)\n-  Email improvements\n-  Independent signup\n-  Linux desktop app\n-  More third-party integrations (including cards, bots, etc.)\n-  Native (Android & iOS) mobile apps\n-  Noise reduction (do not disturb, muting, notification settings, etc.)\n-  Opening Teamwork Chat to users outside the owner company\n-  Search\n\nThat’s all folks! We’ll catch up again next year. Feel free to reach out to us at [chat@teamwork.com](mailto:chat@teamwork.com) with any API or bot-related ideas or features requests. We’d love to know what you’d expect to see in our API.

Since then, we’ve added a few nice features, fixed some bugs, and introduced a couple. You know how it goes. More and more companies are using our app, including some really famous ones. At the time of writing this, over 12 million messages have been sent. Teamwork has grown three times in size, and the Teamwork Chat team with it, thanks to some great hires.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of my predictions from last year’s post;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As NW.js (0.12.0) is basically Chrome (41), we can just put our desktop app on the Web and it will basically just work. That’s a simplification but you get the picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with our Windows and Mac OS X desktop apps, <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">Teamwork Chat</a> is now available in your favourite Web browser. This was almost as easy as we expected. See <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/author/donal/" rel="noopener">Donal’s</a> recent <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/how-we-sped-up-serving-static-files-in-teamwork-chat/" rel="noopener">Deploying the Teamwork Chat Web app</a> post for more.</p>\n<p>Sure, Teamwork Chat is a mobile-first responsive app, so yes, users could access Teamwork Chat on their phones. This was welcomed with open arms, but did I make any mobile <em>app</em> predictions?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even further, we should be able to create Android and iOS apps by sticking our app in a WebView. We’re attempting to build a consistent experience across all platforms from the one codebase. It’s not as easy as I make out though; expect more posts to follow up on this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, and that’s what we’ve done. In this post, I’m going to describe how our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamwork.chat&amp;hl=en" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teamwork-chat/id978062035?mt=8" rel="noopener">iOS</a> apps came to be, lessons we’ve learned along the way, and where we’re headed.

It wasn’t as nice as we thought it would be. We would’ve needed to put in a lot more work to make it really usable. We had bigger fish to fry though. After a painful period of trying to maintain it while delivering key features, it was put to one side. We eventually got back to it, starting again from scratch.</p>\n<p>Of course, we wanted Android and iOS apps which allowed you to do everything you could already do in Teamwork Chat. Push notifications and being able to share a file to the app were minimum requirements as well. Unlike other apps where you could get away without those, they’re critical for any chat app. We imagined that the least the Teamwork Chat mobile apps could do is allow you to contact someone while on the go and stay in the loop, as well as quickly share a photo you’ve just taken, for example.</p>\n<p>Our intention, as much now as it was then, is to have a consistent and familiar experience across all of our apps. Someone should be easily able to start a conversation on one device and carry it on elsewhere.</p>\n<h3><a id="reusing-our-web-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#reusing-our-web-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Reusing our Web app</h3>\n<p>By this stage, users were crying out for mobile apps. Our plan was to get mobile apps out there and improve on them. We planned to reuse our Web app and see how far we could get. We took ownership of (most of) the app as apposed to our mobile team here at Teamwork. We got a lot of the way for free as we had already fought to maintain (mobile-first) reponsiveness and touch-friendliness throughout. We got an iPad app for free due to the fact our app is responsive. Note: we’ve never used device-orientated breakpoints in our designs.</p>\n<p>Now, mobile apps are also considered in every feature from the beginning. Reusing code between our Web, desktop, and mobile apps enables us to fix a bug once and it’s fixed everywhere. As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac &amp; Windows desktop apps, our Android &amp; iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.</p>\n<p>It was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t <em>responsible</em>. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A navigation menu we tweaked.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>We forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.</p>\n<h3><a id="native-wrappers" class="post-header-anchor" href="#native-wrappers" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Native wrappers</h3>\n<p>Enough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.</p>\n<p>The native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.</p>\n<p>Notifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.</p>\n<p>You can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.</p>\n<h3><a id="but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" class="post-header-anchor" href="#but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>But what about <em>real</em> mobile apps?</h3>\n<p>OK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.</p>\n<p>A lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.</p>\n<p>We put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.</p>\n<h3><a id="sharing" class="post-header-anchor" href="#sharing" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Sharing</h3>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Android and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.</p>\n<p>Once the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.</p>\n<p>These days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-parity" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-parity" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature parity</h3>\n<p>This is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.</p>\n<p>This certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.</p>\n<p>Yes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.</p>\n<p>In order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.</p>\n<p>This comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.</p>\n<p>I wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.</p>\n<p>To make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?</p>\n<h3><a id="living-with-a-mobile-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#living-with-a-mobile-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Living with a mobile app</h3>\n<p>Working on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.</p>\n<p>Even though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.</p>\n<p>By changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.</p>\n<p>This is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> to <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a> would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-flags" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-flags" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature flags</h3>\n<p>We’ve been talking about using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">proper feature flags</a> for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.</p>\n<p>Teamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-release" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-release" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The release</h3>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Expecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first. The terrible piece of software that is iTunes Connect gives you the option to release the app immediately once it has been validated, on or past a certain date, as well as a manual release. We opted for a manual release. The plan was that was once we were alerted that the app was ready, we’d submit the Android app, and once that was out, we’d hit the publish button. Note: the Google Play Developer Console (which is awful too) has added a manual release option since then.</p>\n<p>Our iOS app was rejected. Argh! We had marketing campaigns ongoing teasing something big, we had to quickly come up with a plan B. We didn’t want to be empty handed when the end of the month came by. Why did it fail? Basically, there was a misunderstanding in what our app was, and who it was targeted at. We promptly submitted an appeal, and even though we knew we were right, we were amazed to see the decision overturned a couple of days later. The Android release took a couple of hours, and that was it, the Teamwork Chat mobile apps were out there.

One upside to going down the native route is that users can see you care as you’ve tailored an app to their OS. Sure they’ll be distinct, the Android one will have a strong material design feel, but we’ll strive to keep in sync with each other and Teamwork Chat in general when it comes to features as well as the overall experience.</p>\n<p>Sure, this means we’ll have fewer eyes on our Web app on a mobile Web browser or narrow screen, but it’s worth it.</p>\n<h3><a id="automation-and-deployment" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automation-and-deployment" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automation and deployment</h3>\n<p>Right now, our desktop apps need to built on Windows for Windows and on Mac for Mac. This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly <a href="http://dploy.io" rel="noopener">dploy.io</a>) to <a href="https://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a> for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.</p>\n<p>All of our services are now deployed once we push to <code>master</code>. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.</p>\n<p>There are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain <code>[skip-resp-tests]</code> exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.</p>\n<h3><a id="lessons-learned" class="post-header-anchor" href="#lessons-learned" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Lessons learned</h3>\n<p>We haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a>. Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html" rel="noopener"><strong>cluster</strong></a> module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.</p>\n<p>As I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via <code>cluster</code> or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.</p>\n<p>How our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general. We’re going to switch over to RabbitMQ from Redis, re-do a lot of the messaging, and try to remove the dependency on a shared database at the same time.</p>\n<h3><a id="fire-in-the-hole" class="post-header-anchor" href="#fire-in-the-hole" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Fire in the hole</h3>\n<p>As well as improving areas we’ve neglected, these are some of the bigger higher level features we have coming down the line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API</li>\n<li>Bots (prepared third-party bots and a bot API/platform)</li>\n<li>Conversation switcher</li>\n<li>Deeper integrations with <a href="https://teamwork.com/desk" rel="noopener">Teamwork Desk</a> and <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a></li>\n<li>Email improvements</li>\n<li>Independent signup</li>\n<li>Linux desktop app</li>\n<li>More third-party integrations (including cards, bots, etc.)</li>\n<li>Native (Android &amp; iOS) mobile apps</li>\n<li>Noise reduction (do not disturb, muting, notification settings, etc.)</li>\n<li>Opening Teamwork Chat to users outside the owner company</li>\n<li>Search</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all folks!

Since then, we’ve added a few nice features, fixed some bugs, and introduced a couple. You know how it goes. More and more companies are using our app, including some really famous ones. At the time of writing this, over 12 million messages have been sent. Teamwork has grown three times in size, and the Teamwork Chat team with it, thanks to some great hires.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of my predictions from last year’s post;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As NW.js (0.12.0) is basically Chrome (41), we can just put our desktop app on the Web and it will basically just work. That’s a simplification but you get the picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with our Windows and Mac OS X desktop apps, <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/chat" rel="noopener">Teamwork Chat</a> is now available in your favourite Web browser. This was almost as easy as we expected. See <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/author/donal/" rel="noopener">Donal’s</a> recent <a href="http://engineroom.teamwork.com/how-we-sped-up-serving-static-files-in-teamwork-chat/" rel="noopener">Deploying the Teamwork Chat Web app</a> post for more.</p>\n<p>Sure, Teamwork Chat is a mobile-first responsive app, so yes, users could access Teamwork Chat on their phones. This was welcomed with open arms, but did I make any mobile <em>app</em> predictions?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even further, we should be able to create Android and iOS apps by sticking our app in a WebView. We’re attempting to build a consistent experience across all platforms from the one codebase. It’s not as easy as I make out though; expect more posts to follow up on this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, and that’s what we’ve done. In this post, I’m going to describe how our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamwork.chat&amp;hl=en" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teamwork-chat/id978062035?mt=8" rel="noopener">iOS</a> apps came to be, lessons we’ve learned along the way, and where we’re headed.

It wasn’t as nice as we thought it would be. We would’ve needed to put in a lot more work to make it really usable. We had bigger fish to fry though. After a painful period of trying to maintain it while delivering key features, it was put to one side. We eventually got back to it, starting again from scratch.</p>\n<p>Of course, we wanted Android and iOS apps which allowed you to do everything you could already do in Teamwork Chat. Push notifications and being able to share a file to the app were minimum requirements as well. Unlike other apps where you could get away without those, they’re critical for any chat app. We imagined that the least the Teamwork Chat mobile apps could do is allow you to contact someone while on the go and stay in the loop, as well as quickly share a photo you’ve just taken, for example.</p>\n<p>Our intention, as much now as it was then, is to have a consistent and familiar experience across all of our apps. Someone should be easily able to start a conversation on one device and carry it on elsewhere.</p>\n<h3><a id="reusing-our-web-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#reusing-our-web-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Reusing our Web app</h3>\n<p>By this stage, users were crying out for mobile apps. Our plan was to get mobile apps out there and improve on them. We planned to reuse our Web app and see how far we could get. We took ownership of (most of) the app as apposed to our mobile team here at Teamwork. We got a lot of the way for free as we had already fought to maintain (mobile-first) reponsiveness and touch-friendliness throughout. We got an iPad app for free due to the fact our app is responsive. Note: we’ve never used device-orientated breakpoints in our designs.</p>\n<p>Now, mobile apps are also considered in every feature from the beginning. Reusing code between our Web, desktop, and mobile apps enables us to fix a bug once and it’s fixed everywhere. As I said in last year’s post, we use Node.js on the server-side, so we have some modules which are used in our Web app, our Mac &amp; Windows desktop apps, our Android &amp; iOS apps, and some services. Imagine that.</p>\n<p>It was more difficult than we had anticipated. Debugging was trickier for one, and sure we had made an app that was responsive, but it wasn’t <em>responsible</em>. I wish Teamwork Chat really was mobile-first. We should have worked on mobile apps or at least made the Web version first and used it in mobile Web browsers often. The app was far too bloated, it was doing too much all of the time, and so on. A lot of improvements came from making the mobile apps, which in turn improved every Teamwork Chat client as a result. All Teamwork Chat (mobile, Web, and desktop) apps now load faster, take less time to render, and so on, but we still have work to do.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/nav.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>A navigation menu we tweaked.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>We forced ourselves to use our mobile apps exclusively; any interaction we made in Teamwork Chat during the day had to be done in the mobile app. This really helped. We completely redesigned some navigation menus, made some tweaks around touch input, and more. Sure, we already designed our app for touch, but how often did we really use a touch laptop or heavily use the app in a mobile Web browser? Well, clearly not enough. So we fine-grained a few things, including the swipe to show or hide the sidebar.</p>\n<h3><a id="native-wrappers" class="post-header-anchor" href="#native-wrappers" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Native wrappers</h3>\n<p>Enough about the WebView. In this iteration, we decided to drop Appcelerator and go with some native code instead. Sure, this means we’d need two implementations, one in Java and one in Swift, but it’s not so bad. It’s not a lot of code, the end result is better, and it’s what our mobile devs would prefer to work with.</p>\n<p>The native “wrappers” need to show our app in a WebView (which is stored locally), handle notifications, and so on. We found a way to communicate between our app, the native side, and vice versa. I must say it was pretty interesting to co-operate with native mobile developers on this. Once we agreed on the events to be sent back and forth, we were adding little touches which made the app feel a lot more native in no time. For example, if you were to tap the back button on Android, an event is sent into the WebView, and we then close whatever’s open, or hide the sidebar, etc.</p>\n<p>Notifications are another good example. The native side gives us an access token for the app instance on each launch, we send that off to our API and then send you push notifications based on that. We send metadata like the conversation ID in the push, so if you were to tap on it, the native side of our app would instruct our Web app to open the conversation in question, and voilà.</p>\n<p>You can go a step further and clear existing notifications on Android, which is a nice touch. If you were to receive a push notification about a message, but then view it in one of our desktop or Web apps, then the notification would disappear as you’ve already seen the message. When you view a conversation, an event is sent to from your client to ones of our services, and eventually a “silent” (invisible) notification is sent out to your device. Our Java code grabs the conversation ID and clears all associated notifications.</p>\n<h3><a id="but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" class="post-header-anchor" href="#but-what-about-real-mobile-apps" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>But what about <em>real</em> mobile apps?</h3>\n<p>OK, fine! Let’s talk about Web versus native for a second. Web apps on mobile have gotten a bad name, unfairly. “Our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5” is commonly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. Even though I don’t think this is actually what Mark said, people have latched onto this. It’s rubbish. Facebook’s HTML5 push wasn’t very successful at that time for a few reasons, one of which was down to process, for example. They had a dedicated mobile team. Mobile was always an afterthought, and it showed. Now they have mobile developers on every team. Mobile developers are involved and mobile apps are considered from beginning of any feature. If it was up to me, Teamwork Chat would eventually have some mobile developers of its own too.</p>\n<p>A lot of apps you use are hybrid apps but they don’t announce it due to the stigma involved. The feed you see in the Instagram app, who’re owned by Facebook, is HTML.</p>\n<p>We put in the effort to make a responsive app, why not try to flex it? Sure, I’m biased; I want the Web to win and it is possible to do what we had aimed to do. Don’t get me wrong though, fully native apps are the way to go for Teamwork Chat. At the end of this post, I’ll cover what the plans are for our mobile apps and the future of Teamwork Chat in general.</p>\n<h3><a id="sharing" class="post-header-anchor" href="#sharing" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Sharing</h3>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png"><img src="/images/blog-content/under-the-hood-of-a-hybrid-app/sharing.png" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>The screen shown when something is shared to our Android app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Android and iOS diverge when it comes to the concept of sharing. For awhile now on Android, you can easily share anything from one app to another; once you tap the share icon, all apps which can handle files of that type will be shown. Typically, once you select an app, you’re then brought into said app, and how the app handles the rest varies. For example, the Twitter app will show a form to compose a tweet with the image already attached. Once you’re done, you’re still in the app. So we didn’t need to do much on the native side to achieve this. We pass the image data in an event from Java to JavaScript, and show a screen inside the WebView allowing you to choose which conversation to share the file to.</p>\n<p>Once the user selects a conversation or decides to create a new one, we attach the image to the message form. Images are just one example though.</p>\n<p>These days, the right thing to do on iOS is to have a “share extension.” This is almost like a separate app. It lives completely outside your app. What I mean is that when you decide to share something, a completely iOS-y dialog appears, in which the entire flow is contained, and you stay wherever you were once you’re done. So this is written completely in Swift and solely interacts with our API.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-parity" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-parity" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature parity</h3>\n<p>This is something I strongly believe in. I’ll strive to make sure every feature of Teamwork Chat ever released will be released on all platforms and apps at once. There’s nothing worse than seeing a press release for a really cool feature in an app you use, only to realise you’ll have to wait awhile longer than everyone else. You don’t want to alienate your loyal users.</p>\n<p>This certainly applies to mobile apps. Everyone, please stop delivering your app to one platform before the other. Don’t punish anyone because of the device they happened to buy.</p>\n<p>Yes, this means that I believe every feature should be accessible from anywhere, on any device. It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to defend this. Nowadays it’s really hard to even define what “mobile” means anyway. Screen size? Hmm not really anymore. Touch? Not unique. On-the-go? No, a lot of real usage happens on the couch. I won’t go on. The lines are blurred.</p>\n<p>In order to create an app for everywhere, you must design for touch everywhere and strive for simplicity. On the most narrow screen, you need to decide what’s critical for your users, moving on and up from there.</p>\n<p>This comes with some fresh challenges. Releasing both Android and iOS apps at the same time is tough. Especially when there’s internal pressure to release one or the other. It’s hard to convince people at times. We’re users after all, we make stuff to scratch our own itch at Teamwork. I must admit I gave in once or twice, but I’ll continue to fight for it. As it is in general, internal perception is important here.</p>\n<p>I wish more people wrote about feature parity, mobile-first workflows, and the transition from something more archaic. It affects the process of delivering an app in a lot of unexpected ways. For example, I remember having to push back when it came to marketing videos, which typically featured iPhones and iOS only. These growing pains are good though.</p>\n<p>To make this work, more people need to work together and in parallel to deliver something great together. It doesn’t help that your mobile app needs to be reviewed. Android app submissions may only take up to a day to go through validation at worse, but the Apple review process could be anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Not only is it difficult to align all of the releases, but what if a submission gets rejected?</p>\n<h3><a id="living-with-a-mobile-app" class="post-header-anchor" href="#living-with-a-mobile-app" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Living with a mobile app</h3>\n<p>Working on a mobile app is completely alien to Web developers. If you introduce a bug, you can’t just roll out a quick fix and forget about it. It can take a lot of time to release the fix and you’re not guaranteed every user will even accept the update. Luckily, we were already in this frame of mind as we have desktop apps which follow pretty much the same flow.</p>\n<p>Even though we’re used to pushing out desktop app releases, the delay and uncertainty involved here is a pain point. A workaround we’re looking at is updating our app without going through the app store. What I mean is that we ship our mobile app with our Web app inside as usual but when the app is launched, it hits an API or S3, checks for a newer version and downloads it in the background if one exists. Then this version would be used in the WebView on next launch. This would allow us to roll out changes on a whim.</p>\n<p>By changes, I mean changes to the WebView only. Anything else will require a proper app store update. Full updates should be done regularly anyway so it doesn’t look we have never released an update. Also, so we can update the changelogs on the app store listing. It would feel weird to put stuff in the changelogs which have been in the app for awhile though. Yes, I’ve been told I’m paying too much attention to changelogs. We could run into the situation where the WebView or native wrapper sends an event which crashes the app if we were to make a breaking change in our event API.</p>\n<p>This is interesting though; it makes me wonder about how we update our desktop apps. Maybe we could transition to an update process like this. The jury is still out yet though, the implications of a possible move from <a href="http://nwjs.io/" rel="noopener">NW.js</a> to <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="noopener">Electron</a> would need to be taken into account here. You might see a post on this in the future.</p>\n<h3><a id="feature-flags" class="post-header-anchor" href="#feature-flags" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Feature flags</h3>\n<p>We’ve been talking about using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-ccCTmMKY" rel="noopener">proper feature flags</a> for awhile now, but this could be something else which would help us achieve feature parity. The idea would be to put the code for a feature out there on every platform behind a flag. We have this already for tiny things, some code is conditionally ran for just us, etc. When I say “proper features flags” I mean we’d hit an API to get this setting. Once all of the releases are out, we’d enable toggle the feature flag and on next reload or relaunch, the feature would be there.</p>\n<p>Teamwork Chat is very much a single page app though, so it would be even better if a feature could be toggled at runtime. For example, we could enable search for everyone and boom, the search icon appears for everyone. This opens the door for progressively rolling stuff out, to certain accounts, to a percentage of our users, as well as A/B testing, and even disabling the feature again if the fan requires some cleaning.</p>\n<h3><a id="the-release" class="post-header-anchor" href="#the-release" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>The release</h3>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deorlUmLsdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Expecting that we’d be waiting awhile, we submitted our iOS app first. The terrible piece of software that is iTunes Connect gives you the option to release the app immediately once it has been validated, on or past a certain date, as well as a manual release. We opted for a manual release. The plan was that was once we were alerted that the app was ready, we’d submit the Android app, and once that was out, we’d hit the publish button. Note: the Google Play Developer Console (which is awful too) has added a manual release option since then.</p>\n<p>Our iOS app was rejected. Argh! We had marketing campaigns ongoing teasing something big, we had to quickly come up with a plan B. We didn’t want to be empty handed when the end of the month came by. Why did it fail? Basically, there was a misunderstanding in what our app was, and who it was targeted at. We promptly submitted an appeal, and even though we knew we were right, we were amazed to see the decision overturned a couple of days later. The Android release took a couple of hours, and that was it, the Teamwork Chat mobile apps were out there.

We have some mobile developers in-house dying for a crack at it. Expect a couple of great apps that really feel at home in your OS. One upside to going down the native route is that users can see you care as you’ve tailored an app to their OS. Sure they’ll be distinct, the Android one will have a strong material design feel, but we’ll strive to keep in sync with each other and Teamwork Chat in general when it comes to features as well as the overall experience.</p>\n<p>Sure, this means we’ll have fewer eyes on our Web app on a mobile Web browser or narrow screen, but it’s worth it.</p>\n<h3><a id="automation-and-deployment" class="post-header-anchor" href="#automation-and-deployment" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Automation and deployment</h3>\n<p>Right now, our desktop apps need to built on Windows for Windows and on Mac for Mac. This takes time. We’ve added more update channels which compounds the problem. I’d love to automate this. Mobile app builds and deployments could also be automated in a similar fashion. Watch this space.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the topic, I’m happy to say we’ve moved from DeployBot (formerly <a href="http://dploy.io" rel="noopener">dploy.io</a>) to <a href="https://codeship.com/" rel="noopener">CodeShip</a> for all continuous integration and deployment. DeployBot wasn’t reliable enough for us. One time I decided to roll back and it deployed the wrong commit. As well as incidents like that, their frequent maintenance windows seemed to always coincide with when we needed them the most.</p>\n<p>All of our services are now deployed once we push to <code>master</code>. Same goes for the Web version, but we don’t roll out as often as I’d like. Continuous delivery is a target though, for the desktop apps as well as our Web app. Although, to get there, we need more automated tests. We’ve heavily tested certain critical pieces and at least 85% of new services are covered with tests, but we need more. Especially integration tests for clients, ran in multiple browsers concurrently. This is possible, I’ve done it previously with Selenium Grid, etc., we just haven’t made the time for it yet.</p>\n<p>There are also a few tools out there now for testing responsive designs. We could, for example, take screenshots of pages at multiple breakpoints, compare them with the most recent stable ones, and fail the build if the visual diff is too much. Although this might not be a great fit for continuous integration; I’m not sure how it would work if you intentionally introduced a significant visual change. You could disable the test if a certain <code>[skip-resp-tests]</code> exists in the commit message, but what if you accidentally broke something else? Food for thought.</p>\n<h3><a id="lessons-learned" class="post-header-anchor" href="#lessons-learned" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Lessons learned</h3>\n<p>We haven’t had too many scale-related pains, although we’ve found ourselves making more changes lately to take some load off <a href="https://teamwork.com/projects" rel="noopener">Teamwork Projects</a>. Our (email and push) notifications service could certainly be more fault tolerant. We’ve made more use of Node.js’ <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html" rel="noopener"><strong>cluster</strong></a> module which allows us to use all of the cores on any given machine, and might yet solve another problem.</p>\n<p>As I described in last year’s post, our clients connect directly to our WebSocket servers. This means a server rollout will result in users’ clients temporarily disconnecting (plus each of them hitting the API at the same time to get any messages they’ve missed). We’re going to workaround this by effectively hot reloading via <code>cluster</code> or having a dedicated instance in front of our WebSocket servers with the sole duty of accepting WebSocket connections and load-balancing the events that come over them.</p>\n<p>How our services communicate is a bit simplistic in general.

I haven't put pen to paper much since writing [my book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Developing-Electron-Edge-Lynch-2016-06-17/dp/B01K160MV4), as well the follow-up [Smashing Magazine post](https://adamlynch.com/beyond-the-browser-from-web-apps-to-desktop-apps/) and talks.

I've absorbed so much knowledge shared for knowledge sharing's sake. The altruism of the Web community in particular is truly amazing. This blog is an attempt at giving back, playing my part. \n\nIt'll benefit me as well, of course. Writing forces me to further my understanding of topics, for example. I'm not ruling out writing for other blogs again, but I also want a blog that's *mine*. I want freedom, I want control. Plus, side projects are heathy right?\n\n\n### Don't reinvent the wheel, unless you plan on learning more about wheels\n\nI find static site generators fascinating. The end user experience is optimal because it's just static HTML pages, generated in a compile step. It's also a cheaper, more security, and the developer experience is generally better. \n\nI was compelled to write my own static generator using Gulp, Nunjucks templates, Markdown for content, an RSS feed, a pattern library (which is ridiculous looking back now), and more. The output was hosted on GitHub pages (plus CloudFlare HTTPS). This was the last version of my site. \n\nI wanted to do so much and perfect it all but it never got here. Once I had a proof of concept, everything slowed down and my attention went elsewhere. I didn't even get around to properly publishing a blog on the site but I had the proof of concept running locally. Never mind the writing style analyzer, responsive screenshot testing, and other things I had planned to do. I learned that rolling your own static site generator isn't as difficult as it sounds. I might write a post on that.\n\nThe following were my (unordered) requirements this time around.\n\n\n#### Must have\n\n- Doesn't need client-side JavaScript.\n- Crawlable.\n- Isn't restrictive on where the content comes from (e.g. files, API, DB, etc).\n- Flexible (e.g. what if I want to plug sass-lint in?).\n- Can be automated (i.e. continuous integration).\n- Allows Markdown posts.\n- Code can be embedded with CodePen, JSFiddle, etc.\n- Allows for custom / non-blog pages. \n- Allows for multiple post templates / types.\n- Open-source.\n- Supports Linux, Mac, and Windows.\n\n\n#### Nice to have\n\n- Simple.\n- Gives a head start on SEO.\n- Allows you to push the data elsewhere (Medium).\n- Uses tools I'm familiar with and am liking right now.\n- Allows posts in other formats along side Markdown posts.\n- Makes the client-side experience faster / better (progressive enhancement) and if it does, it's lightweight.\n- Service worker head start.\n- Not opinionated.\n- Generates RSS feed.\n- Head start on blog stuff.\n- Content updates can be suggested by readers.\n- Good development experience.\n- Head start on comments.\n- Head start on analytics.\n- Generates sitemap.xml.\n\n\n#### Unimportant\n\n- Build speed.\n- Popularity.\n- Themes.\n\n:::figure static-site-regeneration/nuxt.png\n:::\n\n### Winner\n\nI won't bore you by going into detail on each option I considered. [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) won in the end. It's a minimal framework for creating \"universal Vue.js apps,\" but hmm what does that mean? \n\nWell first there's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a modern JavaScript framework with Virtual DOM diffing, first-class Flux state management, and fantastic documentation. It's our frontend framework of choice at [Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com/). But wait, that sounds like way too much for a blog. It doesn't need to be a web app, never mind a \"universal Vue.js app.\" Trust me, it gets better. \n\nNext, there's Nuxt.js. It's a minimal (opinionated) framework which abstracts away Vue.js and Webpack for you. You don't need to set up routing or anything like that (although you can if you'd like). If you were to create a `hello` component inside the `pages` directory, you could run one command to generate a Vue.js web app in which `/hello` would resolve to that component (like [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)). Since it abstracts away Webpack, it has a great development mode, including hot module reloading and more, out of the box.\n\nA \"Universal Vue.js app\" just means that it does some server-side rendering and client-side hydration. So let's say you go to a URL. Typically, the server would return a pretty much empty page which loads some JavaScript, which runs your Vue.js code, which hits an API, then renders a table and adds an event listener so that clicking on a table header would sort the table. A \"universal Vue.js app\" would instead run your Vue.js code on the server-side, which would hit the API, render the result, and return the table in the initial response to the browser. So you get the content as soon as possible, whether or not you've JavaScript enabled, whether or not the JavaScript has a fatal error, and so on. Then the JavaScript is loaded and continues from where the server-side rendering left off (i.e. client-side hydration). If you were to click on a table header, it should be ready and sort the table.\n\nSince it can run and render your Vue.js code on the server-side, it supports static site generation. It's so powerful yet all I need to do is run a slightly different command and it'll spit out static assets. The Nuxt.js logo is also weirdly similar to my own.\n\n\n### Content management\n\nThis doesn't mean I'm going to write blog posts in HTML though. You might've noticed this one interesting requirement: \"Isn't restrictive on where the content comes from (e.g. files, API, DB, etc).\" I wanted to explore other sources of content. A headless CMS, for example. Instead of hosting a CMS and having every request to my blog run through, let's say, Ghost or Wordpress, I could just use them to manage the content. It would be \"headless\" in that I'd only be using the administration panel.  I'd grab the posts by querying its database (or using its API if it has one). Since the phrase has been coined, purpose-built headless CMSs have popped up which only expose APIs and no frontend UI. \n\n\"[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)\" has since gained momentum; a \"modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.\" Isn't that just static site generation? Well JAMstackers(?) don't like the term \"static\" because the API could return anything really and therefore the site can be pretty dynamic. I'd prefer to hit the API at compile-time, generate static files, and have less client-side JavaScript. So for my purposes, it is static site generation.\n\nI've always wanted to play around with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), a cloud-based headless CMS service. It seems really good, but I ended up choosing a Git-based approach again. Contentful doesn't support Markdown for one (EDIT: it does support Markdown, since February 2014 actually. I don't know how I missed this). Even though the editor is good, I would have no choice but to use it. I can use whatever I like with Git; a text editor, IDE, [Classeur](http://classeur.io/) (my favourite Markdown editor), etc. \n\nI get versioning for free, branching, and it works offline (up until actually publishing changes).\nSince my site is hosted on GitHub (still), I can use its UI to not only edit files but add and delete blog posts too. Another thing I love is that everything is open-source so anyone could suggest improvements to a post. I even have a button at the top of the page for this. Right now it just brings you to the [source code](https://github.com/adam-lynch/adam-lynch.github.io/), but I'll make it so it brings you to the actual post's source content. It could even have quality checks via continuous integration services.\n\nContentful does have built-in responsive image support and search API endpoints though. I'm definitely going to use it somehow, I'm just looking for the right excuse.\n\n\n### Markdown, meet Nuxt.js\n\nSo how do I actually write posts then? Nuxt.js allows you to build modules that tap into the build or generation steps to do custom stuff. A [blog module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/blog-module) already existed. It wasn't flexible enough so I took it and modified it to my needs (which we've found ourselves doing with most Vue.js related things at Teamwork). It looks for markdown files in a `writing` directory, compiles the Markdown, then generates the files, routes, and anything else. The Markdown compiler I've gone with this time is [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), plus some (third-party and custom) plugins for some additional capabilities. I might write a post on this someday.\n\nThe only downside really was that an RSS module didn't exist so I could match the functionality of my old site. I wrote one but ended up throwing it away when I ran into a tricky last-minute issue.\n\n\n### Imperfection\n\nI'm trying to be more open to shipping less than perfect things these days, so I've definitely left room for improvement. Some of the code is the most hacked together I've ever written. Especially the CSS, which is basically all in one `shame.scss` file. Although this route transition is nice.\n\n\n:::figure static-site-regeneration/route-transition.gif The route [transition](https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-transition/) when going from the list of posts to an individual one. It involves a bit of positioning logic, automated scrolling, animations, and [skeleton](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797) text which is shown while the post's content is loading.\n:::\n\nOne thing that's a challenge when going static are comments. You don't get built-in comments like you would with a typical CMS. I've used [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for the time being but I'm not very happy with it. It's way too heavy. Expect a post on switching to an alternative solution or rolling my own. The workflow could be improved as well. I'd like to automate the asset generation as a continuous deployment step.\n\nAs far as content goes, expect me to publish a post a month, roughly. I'll mostly cover development but I might throw in a post every now and again about other stuff as well. There'll be short posts, deep detailed dives which I've have edited forty times, as well posts I've written in one go (sometimes they're my best). I've so many things I've been meaning to play around with. Now I've an outlet where I can write about them.\n",unfilteredRenderedBody:'<h2><a id="static-site-regeneration-and-focusing-on-whats-important" class="post-header-anchor" href="#static-site-regeneration-and-focusing-on-whats-important" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Static site regeneration and focusing on what\'s important</h2>\n<article-summary><p>I\'ve had my own site for years now but I haven\'t used it for much.

It\'s a minimal framework for creating &quot;universal Vue.js apps,&quot; but hmm what does that mean?</p>\n<p>Well first there\'s <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener">Vue.js</a>, a modern JavaScript framework with Virtual DOM diffing, first-class Flux state management, and fantastic documentation. It\'s our frontend framework of choice at <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/" rel="noopener">Teamwork</a>. But wait, that sounds like way too much for a blog. It doesn\'t need to be a web app, never mind a &quot;universal Vue.js app.&quot; Trust me, it gets better.</p>\n<p>Next, there\'s Nuxt.js. It\'s a minimal (opinionated) framework which abstracts away Vue.js and Webpack for you. You don\'t need to set up routing or anything like that (although you can if you\'d like). If you were to create a <code>hello</code> component inside the <code>pages</code> directory, you could run one command to generate a Vue.js web app in which <code>/hello</code> would resolve to that component (like <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/" rel="noopener">Next.js</a>). Since it abstracts away Webpack, it has a great development mode, including hot module reloading and more, out of the box.</p>\n<p>A &quot;Universal Vue.js app&quot; just means that it does some server-side rendering and client-side hydration. So let\'s say you go to a URL. Typically, the server would return a pretty much empty page which loads some JavaScript, which runs your Vue.js code, which hits an API, then renders a table and adds an event listener so that clicking on a table header would sort the table. A &quot;universal Vue.js app&quot; would instead run your Vue.js code on the server-side, which would hit the API, render the result, and return the table in the initial response to the browser. So you get the content as soon as possible, whether or not you\'ve JavaScript enabled, whether or not the JavaScript has a fatal error, and so on. Then the JavaScript is loaded and continues from where the server-side rendering left off (i.e. client-side hydration). If you were to click on a table header, it should be ready and sort the table.</p>\n<p>Since it can run and render your Vue.js code on the server-side, it supports static site generation. It\'s so powerful yet all I need to do is run a slightly different command and it\'ll spit out static assets. The Nuxt.js logo is also weirdly similar to my own.</p>\n<h3><a id="content-management" class="post-header-anchor" href="#content-management" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Content management</h3>\n<p>This doesn\'t mean I\'m going to write blog posts in HTML though. You might\'ve noticed this one interesting requirement: &quot;Isn\'t restrictive on where the content comes from (e.g. files, API, DB, etc).&quot; I wanted to explore other sources of content. A headless CMS, for example. Instead of hosting a CMS and having every request to my blog run through, let\'s say, Ghost or Wordpress, I could just use them to manage the content. It would be &quot;headless&quot; in that I\'d only be using the administration panel.  I\'d grab the posts by querying its database (or using its API if it has one). Since the phrase has been coined, purpose-built headless CMSs have popped up which only expose APIs and no frontend UI.</p>\n<p>&quot;<a href="https://jamstack.org/" rel="noopener">JAMstack</a>&quot; has since gained momentum; a &quot;modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.&quot; Isn\'t that just static site generation? Well JAMstackers(?) don\'t like the term &quot;static&quot; because the API could return anything really and therefore the site can be pretty dynamic. I\'d prefer to hit the API at compile-time, generate static files, and have less client-side JavaScript. So for my purposes, it is static site generation.</p>\n<p>I\'ve always wanted to play around with <a href="https://www.contentful.com/" rel="noopener">Contentful</a>, a cloud-based headless CMS service. It seems really good, but I ended up choosing a Git-based approach again. Contentful doesn\'t support Markdown for one (EDIT: it does support Markdown, since February 2014 actually. I don\'t know how I missed this). Even though the editor is good, I would have no choice but to use it. I can use whatever I like with Git; a text editor, IDE, <a href="http://classeur.io/" rel="noopener">Classeur</a> (my favourite Markdown editor), etc.</p>\n<p>I get versioning for free, branching, and it works offline (up until actually publishing changes).<br>\nSince my site is hosted on GitHub (still), I can use its UI to not only edit files but add and delete blog posts too. Another thing I love is that everything is open-source so anyone could suggest improvements to a post. I even have a button at the top of the page for this. Right now it just brings you to the <a href="https://github.com/adam-lynch/adam-lynch.github.io/" rel="noopener">source code</a>, but I\'ll make it so it brings you to the actual post\'s source content. It could even have quality checks via continuous integration services.</p>\n<p>Contentful does have built-in responsive image support and search API endpoints though. I\'m definitely going to use it somehow, I\'m just looking for the right excuse.</p>\n<h3><a id="markdown-meet-nuxtjs" class="post-header-anchor" href="#markdown-meet-nuxtjs" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Markdown, meet Nuxt.js</h3>\n<p>So how do I actually write posts then? Nuxt.js allows you to build modules that tap into the build or generation steps to do custom stuff. A <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/blog-module" rel="noopener">blog module</a> already existed. It wasn\'t flexible enough so I took it and modified it to my needs (which we\'ve found ourselves doing with most Vue.js related things at Teamwork). It looks for markdown files in a <code>writing</code> directory, compiles the Markdown, then generates the files, routes, and anything else. The Markdown compiler I\'ve gone with this time is <a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it" rel="noopener">markdown-it</a>, plus some (third-party and custom) plugins for some additional capabilities. I might write a post on this someday.</p>\n<p>The only downside really was that an RSS module didn\'t exist so I could match the functionality of my old site. I wrote one but ended up throwing it away when I ran into a tricky last-minute issue.</p>\n<h3><a id="imperfection" class="post-header-anchor" href="#imperfection" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Imperfection</h3>\n<p>I\'m trying to be more open to shipping less than perfect things these days, so I\'ve definitely left room for improvement. Some of the code is the most hacked together I\'ve ever written. Especially the CSS, which is basically all in one <code>shame.scss</code> file. Although this route transition is nice.</p>\n<figure>\n          <a href="/images/blog-content/static-site-regeneration/route-transition.gif"><img src="/images/blog-content/static-site-regeneration/route-transition.gif" alt=""/></a>\n          <figcaption><p>The route <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-transition/" rel="noopener">transition</a> when going from the list of posts to an individual one. It involves a bit of positioning logic, automated scrolling, animations, and <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797" rel="noopener">skeleton</a> text which is shown while the post\'s content is loading.</p>\n</figcaption>\n        </figure><p>One thing that\'s a challenge when going static are comments. You don\'t get built-in comments like you would with a typical CMS. I\'ve used <a href="https://disqus.com/" rel="noopener">Disqus</a> for the time being but I\'m not very happy with it. It\'s way too heavy. Expect a post on switching to an alternative solution or rolling my own. The workflow could be improved as well. I\'d like to automate the asset generation as a continuous deployment step.</p>\n<p>As far as content goes, expect me to publish a post a month, roughly. I\'ll mostly cover development but I might throw in a post every now and again about other stuff as well. There\'ll be short posts, deep detailed dives which I\'ve have edited forty times, as well posts I\'ve written in one go (sometimes they\'re my best). I\'ve so many things I\'ve been meaning to play around with. Now I\'ve an outlet where I can write about them.</p>\n',attributes:{date:"2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z",tags:[{id:"writing",name:"writing"},{id:"static-site-generation",name:"static-site-generation"},{id:"headless-cms",name:"headless-cms"},{id:"jamstack",name:"jamstack"},{id:"git",name:"git"},{id:"markdown",name:"markdown"},{id:"vuejs",name:"vue.js"},{id:"nuxtjs",name:"nuxt.js"},{id:"javascript",name:"javascript"},{id:"development",name:"development"}],title:"Static site regeneration and focusing on what's important",updated_at:"2019-05-22T08:26:34.147Z",photo:"/images/blog-content/static-site-regeneration/nuxt.png"},title:"Static site regeneration and focusing on what's important",renderedSummary:"<p>I've had my own site for years now but I haven't used it for much.

It\'s a minimal framework for creating &quot;universal Vue.js apps,&quot; but hmm what does that mean?</p>\n<p>Well first there\'s <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener">Vue.js</a>, a modern JavaScript framework with Virtual DOM diffing, first-class Flux state management, and fantastic documentation. It\'s our frontend framework of choice at <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/" rel="noopener">Teamwork</a>. But wait, that sounds like way too much for a blog. It doesn\'t need to be a web app, never mind a &quot;universal Vue.js app.&quot; Trust me, it gets better.</p>\n<p>Next, there\'s Nuxt.js. It\'s a minimal (opinionated) framework which abstracts away Vue.js and Webpack for you. You don\'t need to set up routing or anything like that (although you can if you\'d like). If you were to create a <code>hello</code> component inside the <code>pages</code> directory, you could run one command to generate a Vue.js web app in which <code>/hello</code> would resolve to that component (like <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/" rel="noopener">Next.js</a>). Since it abstracts away Webpack, it has a great development mode, including hot module reloading and more, out of the box.</p>\n<p>A &quot;Universal Vue.js app&quot; just means that it does some server-side rendering and client-side hydration. So let\'s say you go to a URL. Typically, the server would return a pretty much empty page which loads some JavaScript, which runs your Vue.js code, which hits an API, then renders a table and adds an event listener so that clicking on a table header would sort the table. A &quot;universal Vue.js app&quot; would instead run your Vue.js code on the server-side, which would hit the API, render the result, and return the table in the initial response to the browser. So you get the content as soon as possible, whether or not you\'ve JavaScript enabled, whether or not the JavaScript has a fatal error, and so on. Then the JavaScript is loaded and continues from where the server-side rendering left off (i.e. client-side hydration). If you were to click on a table header, it should be ready and sort the table.</p>\n<p>Since it can run and render your Vue.js code on the server-side, it supports static site generation. It\'s so powerful yet all I need to do is run a slightly different command and it\'ll spit out static assets. The Nuxt.js logo is also weirdly similar to my own.</p>\n<h3><a id="content-management" class="post-header-anchor" href="#content-management" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Content management</h3>\n<p>This doesn\'t mean I\'m going to write blog posts in HTML though. You might\'ve noticed this one interesting requirement: &quot;Isn\'t restrictive on where the content comes from (e.g. files, API, DB, etc).&quot; I wanted to explore other sources of content. A headless CMS, for example. Instead of hosting a CMS and having every request to my blog run through, let\'s say, Ghost or Wordpress, I could just use them to manage the content. It would be &quot;headless&quot; in that I\'d only be using the administration panel.  I\'d grab the posts by querying its database (or using its API if it has one). Since the phrase has been coined, purpose-built headless CMSs have popped up which only expose APIs and no frontend UI.</p>\n<p>&quot;<a href="https://jamstack.org/" rel="noopener">JAMstack</a>&quot; has since gained momentum; a &quot;modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.&quot; Isn\'t that just static site generation? Well JAMstackers(?) don\'t like the term &quot;static&quot; because the API could return anything really and therefore the site can be pretty dynamic. I\'d prefer to hit the API at compile-time, generate static files, and have less client-side JavaScript. So for my purposes, it is static site generation.</p>\n<p>I\'ve always wanted to play around with <a href="https://www.contentful.com/" rel="noopener">Contentful</a>, a cloud-based headless CMS service. It seems really good, but I ended up choosing a Git-based approach again. Contentful doesn\'t support Markdown for one (EDIT: it does support Markdown, since February 2014 actually. I don\'t know how I missed this). Even though the editor is good, I would have no choice but to use it. I can use whatever I like with Git; a text editor, IDE, <a href="http://classeur.io/" rel="noopener">Classeur</a> (my favourite Markdown editor), etc.</p>\n<p>I get versioning for free, branching, and it works offline (up until actually publishing changes).<br>\nSince my site is hosted on GitHub (still), I can use its UI to not only edit files but add and delete blog posts too. Another thing I love is that everything is open-source so anyone could suggest improvements to a post. I even have a button at the top of the page for this. Right now it just brings you to the <a href="https://github.com/adam-lynch/adam-lynch.github.io/" rel="noopener">source code</a>, but I\'ll make it so it brings you to the actual post\'s source content. It could even have quality checks via continuous integration services.</p>\n<p>Contentful does have built-in responsive image support and search API endpoints though. I\'m definitely going to use it somehow, I\'m just looking for the right excuse.</p>\n<h3><a id="markdown-meet-nuxtjs" class="post-header-anchor" href="#markdown-meet-nuxtjs" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Markdown, meet Nuxt.js</h3>\n<p>So how do I actually write posts then? Nuxt.js allows you to build modules that tap into the build or generation steps to do custom stuff. A <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/blog-module" rel="noopener">blog module</a> already existed. It wasn\'t flexible enough so I took it and modified it to my needs (which we\'ve found ourselves doing with most Vue.js related things at Teamwork). It looks for markdown files in a <code>writing</code> directory, compiles the Markdown, then generates the files, routes, and anything else. The Markdown compiler I\'ve gone with this time is <a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it" rel="noopener">markdown-it</a>, plus some (third-party and custom) plugins for some additional capabilities. I might write a post on this someday.</p>\n<p>The only downside really was that an RSS module didn\'t exist so I could match the functionality of my old site. I wrote one but ended up throwing it away when I ran into a tricky last-minute issue.</p>\n<h3><a id="imperfection" class="post-header-anchor" href="#imperfection" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M5.88.03c-.18.01-.36.03-.53.09-.27.1-.53.25-.75.47a.5.5 0 1 0 .69.69c.11-.11.24-.17.38-.22.35-.12.78-.07 1.06.22.39.39.39 1.04 0 1.44l-1.5 1.5c-.44.44-.8.48-1.06.47-.26-.01-.41-.13-.41-.13a.5.5 0 1 0-.5.88s.34.22.84.25c.5.03 1.2-.16 1.81-.78l1.5-1.5c.78-.78.78-2.04 0-2.81-.28-.28-.61-.45-.97-.53-.18-.04-.38-.04-.56-.03zm-2 2.31c-.5-.02-1.19.15-1.78.75l-1.5 1.5c-.78.78-.78 2.04 0 2.81.56.56 1.36.72 2.06.47.27-.1.53-.25.75-.47a.5.5 0 1 0-.69-.69c-.11.11-.24.17-.38.22-.35.12-.78.07-1.06-.22-.39-.39-.39-1.04 0-1.44l1.5-1.5c.4-.4.75-.45 1.03-.44.28.01.47.09.47.09a.5.5 0 1 0 .44-.88s-.34-.2-.84-.22z"></path></svg></a>Imperfection</h3>\n<p>I\'m trying to be more open to shipping less than perfect things these days, so I\'ve definitely left room for improvement. Some of the code is the most hacked together I\'ve ever written. Especially the CSS, which is basically all in one <code>shame.scss</code> file.

You don\'t get built-in comments like you would with a typical CMS. I\'ve used <a href="https://disqus.com/" rel="noopener">Disqus</a> for the time being but I\'m not very happy with it. It\'s way too heavy. Expect a post on switching to an alternative solution or rolling my own. The workflow could be improved as well. I\'d like to automate the asset generation as a continuous deployment step.</p>\n<p>As far as content goes, expect me to publish a post a month, roughly. I\'ll mostly cover development but I might throw in a post every now and again about other stuff as well. There\'ll be short posts, deep detailed dives which I\'ve have edited forty times, as well posts I\'ve written in one go (sometimes they\'re my best). I\'ve so many things I\'ve been meaning to play around with. Now I\'ve an outlet where I can write about them.</p>\n',summary:"I've had my own site for years now but I haven't used it for much.
